title: Emaad's fastpages
description: An easy to use blogging platform with support for Jupyter Notebooks.
github_username: Emaad-Mir
# you can comment the below line out if your repo name is not different than your baseurl
github_repo: "emaad-fastpages"

# OPTIONAL: override baseurl and url if using a custom domain
# Note: leave out the trailing / from this value. 
url: "https://Emaad-Mir.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com

###########################################################
#########  Special Instructions for baseurl ###############
#
#### Scenario One: If you do not have a Custom Domain #####
#    -  if you are not using a custom domain, the baseurl *must* be set to your repo name
# 
####  Scenario Two: If you have a Custom Domain #####
# 1. If your domain does NOT have a subpath, this leave this value as ""
# 2. If your domain does have a subpath, you must preceed the value with a / and NOT have a / at the end.  
#      For example: 
#           "" is valid
#           "/blog"        is valid
#            "/blog/site/" is invalid  ( / at the end)
#            "/blog/site"  is valid
#            "blog/site"   is invalid  ( because doesn't begin with a /)
#
# 3. You must replace the parameter `baseurl` in _action_files/settings.ini with the same value as you set here but WITHOUT QUOTES.
#
baseurl: "/emaad-fastpages" # the subpath of your site, e.g. "/blog".

weekly_summaries: [
  We installed tools like Anaconda and Python and started building our Fastpages blogs. 
  The hacks for this week were to post our first markdown post and jupyter notebook.,
  We started to learn more about Python and used what was taught to make our own quiz that had questions pertaining to what we learned. 
  We also installed the bash kernel and made a notebook that demonstrated all necessary tools functioning.,
  We began working with lists and dictionaries in Python. Both of these are used to collect specific information. We were also introduced
  to HTML fragments and learned how they are used in well-known websites like Amazon. Using our knowledge of all of these concepts we had to
  show several looping algorithms and demonstrate what happened when we tried to change the remote theme of the blog.,
  We were introduced to the Create Performance Task portion of the AP CSP exam and reviewed a blog created by a former
  student detailing how she got a 5 on the AP exam. We also started working with code.org in which we had to make our own quiz about 
  any topic we wanted. This week's hacks allowed us to really think about the AP exam and how we can apply our creativity to produce
  programs that can perform astonishing tasks.
