            "content": "Take some additional notes that you would like here for 3.12 and 3.13. We will be looking for additional notes from the presentation. . What are procedures? . Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: A named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. Procedures can also be referred to as a method or function, depending on the language. . Parameters: Input values of a procedure. . Arguments: Specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called. . Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality. . Procedural Abstraction: Process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it. . What are some other names for procedures?: Depending on the language, procedures can also be referred to as a method or a function. . Why are procedures effective?: Procedures are effective because it gives us the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program. It also makes it convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code. . Extra/Additional Notes . A procedure may or may not return a value | A procedure call interrupts a series of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure | Procedural abstraction allows a solution to a large problem based on the solution of smaller problems | Some of the benefits of using procedures include... Gives the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program | Allows us to break the code up and abstract what different parts of the code does (helps us identify/correct errors) | Without procedures, we would have to look at all of the code line by line | . | . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): b = &quot;&quot; while n &gt; 0: r = n % 2 b = str(r) + b n = n // 2 # this adds 0s to the left return b.zfill(8) print(convertToBinary(decimal)) . 00000111 . In addition to the above code segment, I also created another segment in which the user can choose the number that they would like to convert into binary, which is shown below in Python: . def convertToBinary(n): # b represents the binary number b = &quot;&quot; # n represents the decimal number that will be converted into the binary number while n &gt; 0: # r represents the remainder r = n % 2 b = str(r) + b n = n // 2 return b.zfill(8) n = int(input(&quot;What decimal number would you like to convert to binary?&quot;)) print(&quot;User input: &quot;, n) b = convertToBinary(n) print(&quot;The number {} in binary is {}&quot;.format(n,b)) . User input: 672 The number 672 in binary is 1010100000 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . def findMax(numberA, numberB): if numberA &gt; numberB: print(numberA) else: print(numberB) def findMin(numberA, numberB): if numberA &lt; numberB: print(numberA) else: print(numberB) findMax(11, 43) findMin(21, 910) . 43 21 . JavaScript Version . Note: Whenever I try running the JavaScript version, I always get that there is a syntax error. I have thoroughly looked through my code to make sure that I did not miss anything and have looked up to see if anyone else has had this problem. Unfortunately, I have had no luck getting my code to work. Below is what I would have done if my JavaScript kernel was working properly: . function findMax(numberA, numberB) { if (numberA &gt; numberB) { console.log(numberA); } else { console.log(numberB); } } function findMin(numberA, numberB) { if (numberA &lt; numberB) { console.log(numberA); } else { console.log(numberB); } } // test the functions findMax(381, 8488320); findMin(7, 1) . Cell In[7], line 1 function findMax(numberA, numberB) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def charToBinary(x): binary_string = &quot;&quot; for char in x: binary_char = bin(ord(char))[2:] # this is what converts the character to binary and also removes the &quot;0b&quot; prefix so that it doesn&#39;t show up in the output binary_string += binary_char + &quot; &quot; return binary_string # this allows the user to convert any set of strings into binary x = input(&quot;Enter a string of characters:&quot;) print(&quot;Enter a string of characters&quot;) print(&quot;You entered {}&quot;.format(x)) # converts the string to binary and prints the result binary_string = charToBinary(x) print(&quot;{} in binary is {}&quot;.format(x, binary_string)) . Enter a string of characters You entered APCSP APCSP in binary is 1000001 1010000 1000011 1010011 1010000 .",

            "content": "What is the Purpose of This Calendar Here? . I actually had made a project similar to this for our Trimester 1 Final, which only gave users the option to add events and nothing else beyond that. However, now that we are in Trimester 3 (which is wrapping up soon!), I wanted to use what I had in trimester 1 and refine it to reflect everything that I had learned about JavaScript over the seven or so months since I made it. . What Can You Do With This Calendar? . The calendar of course still gives users the option to add events that they would like and the calendar can only be used for one month; however, I have now implemented code that allows users to edit and remove existing events on the calendar and even allow them to clear all of the events at once if they would like. I also styled the buttons a bit more so that it was visually pleasing and colored the calendar for the same reason. . The Calendar Itself . Below is the calendar that you can use to add and organize events on certain days for the month of June. While my code only allows the user to input events for the month of June, they can update the calendar monthly so that it accurately represents the current time. To type in a date, the user can either type it in themselves in the mm-dd-yyyy format box or they can click on the calendar icon inside the box. . . June .

            "content": "Summary of the Event (Presenting Our Project) . Night at the Museum (N@TM) was on May 31, 2023. There were three time slots for the different classes, and we (period 4 Yeung) had to be at the event to present our work from 7:00pm-7:30pm. We all decided to bring our laptops to the event so that we could show curious people and the teacher our final project. All of us had the opportunity to present to guests who attended the event, and the room was very crowded with teams from other periods having their laptops out. After the teacher saw our project functioning the way it was supposed to and showing our work to everybody, we all left the room to go and look at work from other electives. . Projects from Other Classes . After our time to present ended, we all went around to look at other projects for this class and other electives, such as 3D Animation, Ceramics, AP Studio Art, and many more. I was fascinated by what I was seeing and was amazed at how talented students around my age can be with their art work. I could very much see a lot of effort and dedication was put into the projects that I saw, and it overall made me feel inspired to start approaching any art-related activities with a positive mindset. . Here are pictures of some of the projects that I took at N@TM! I include some brief notes about each project and what I really liked about it or caught my eye. I hope you like them as much as I did! :) . CSP (This Class!) . Assortment of Games . . I was amazed at how detailed and interactive the frontend was | I really liked how you could not only see your review of the cafe but also reviews from other people | I was interested in how the project was able to calculate the average rating from all reviews left by others | The main purpose of this application was to entertain users with games and allow them to provide feedback on the website | . Jupyter Notebook stuff and relation to Frontend . . The frontend was very interactive and had a cool design | The teammate that was presenting did a great job at explaining to us how the project worked and at showing us a demo of the project functioning | While not 100% complete, I still enjoyed learning about the project along with other people who were interested in looking at it | The main purpose of this project was to provide users with a personal fitness plan based on their calories, height, weight, etc. | . CSA FRQ Tests . . I had the opportunity to try out the snake game, which was very entertaining | I was amazed at how the project also implemented a leader board that kept track of everyone’s score | Not 100% complete, as the teammate presenting this informed us that they were still trying to figure out how to prevent cheating, as the final scores are inputted by the user and not automatically generated; however, I still enjoyed playing around with some of the arcade games | The purpose of this project was to provide entertainment for the user with an assortment of games, such as Snake as shown in the image above | . 3D Animation . . As someone who took 3D Animation 1-2, I was impressed by how the person was able to make the donut look very realistic (probably better than mine!) | The light shined on the donut’s frosting is especially satisfying to look at | I liked how the donut was up close, as this told us that the donut was the emphasis of the project | . . I liked how detailed yet simple the chair and table were | The blue background goes well with the color of the objects | The overall scene is very realistic and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into it | . . Recalling some of the criteria for this project, I really liked how the person included chairs on all sides of the table, as it makes the scene look more “complete” (don’t know how else to describe it) | The designs of the ground and chairs makes the scene look very realistic | I especially found the shiny parts of the table pleasing to look at | . . I was amazed at how realistic the dribbling of the donut frosting was | The coffee inside the cup looks very realistic along with the glass cup itself | The background color goes well with the colors and designs of the donut and coffee | . Ceramics . . I was impressed by how detailed the face | I could tell that a lot of effort was put into the eyes and mouth | The entire thing was, simply put, satisfying and pleasing to look at with some friends | . . I liked how shiny the octopus was | The colors used go really well together | Overall, there was definitely a lot of attention to detail | . . The watering pot looks very real, which shows that there was a lot of effort put into making it look like a real one | I like how shiny different parts of the watering pot was | It was really interesting and pleasing to look at | . Design and Mixed Media (I Think?) . . Looking at this piece of art has made me amazed that there are many students who are around my age that have the talent and skill to create art like this | I liked how some parts of the hair and skin were made a bit darker compared to everything else to give off a more “real” effect | The word “race” makes me curious about what this piece is trying to convey | . N@tM Reflection . I had a really good time looking at work from not only our class, but also work from other electives such as 3D Animation, Ceramics, and Design and Mixed Media. Regardless of where the projects came from, looking at them made me amazed at how talented our generation is and how we have the ability to put out work like this. I was especially interested in the projects from 3D Animation, as I myself have taken the class and remember some of the projects that we had to do. Looking at the work from that class made me think about what I could have done better when I was in that class, which will definitely be helpful if I plan on becoming a 3D artist in the long run. I also enjoyed being able to look at all of these projects with other people, as doing so gave us the opportunity to discuss what we thought about them. Overall, N@tM for Trimester 3 was an amazing experience and I hope to attend more events like these in the future. .",

Question 32 involved figuring out which pseudocode segment could be used to calculate the finalGrade using the procedure calls given in the table. While the concept behind this question was not particularly difficult, I ended up getting this question wrong, as I likely assumed that by subtracting the smallest of the scores in the list of scores that it would also drop the lowest score. This caused me to choose C, which divided the sum after subtracting the lowest score by the length of the list before the lowest score was moved, which was incorrect. I now know that I should carefully read what is on the code segment, as not doing so here is what caused me to get this exact question wrong. For a question like this, I need to make sure that I look at the important parts of each choice and to not overthink it, as doing so could make me lose valuable time and in fact make it more likely for me to choose the wrong answer. . Question 22 . The next question to review is question 22, shown below: . . This question’s correct answer was A, as shown above. For this question, I had to keep track of everything that was happening as the procedure NumOccurences iterated through wordList. I was able to successfully do this for A, as I could see that the count of “birch” would be increased to one the first time that it was seen before count would be reset to 0 after moving on to the next work. For the other choice, however, I failed to see that option C would display the intended result, since the word oak is the last element of the list and only occurs once, displaying the result 1. B is the other correct answer because while “count” for the word maple becomes 1 the first time it is equal to the targetWord, the count resets after moving on to the word “oak”, which causes the program to display 0 as the result instead of 1. This is why I believe that this question will be an especially important one to review while we study for the AP exam. One way I can improve my confidence with questions like these is to write down what is happening rather than just trying to do everything in my head, as if I do it in my head, I will be more likely to make a mistake. . Question 41 . The next question to review is question 41, shown below: . . The correct answer to this question was A, which was the answer shown above. While the concept behind this question was not particularly difficult, similar to the last question reviewed, I had to keep track of what was happening and where the robot was on the grid. Whether the robot had to move forward or rotate right, I needed to make sure that I noted down where the robot was and imagine what it would like if the robot were to rotate in a certain direction. As previously mentioned, one way I can improve my ability to answer these questions with more confidence is to perhaps write or even draw out what is happening, as I know that we will be provided with some paper for the AP exam. While it may not be necessary, especially for a computer science class, I have sometimes found it helpful when I write stuff down, as I can clearly see what is happening and am more easily able to pick the correct answer. . Question 48 . The last question to review is question 48, shown below: . . The correct answer for this question was C, which is highlighted in green above. This question is quite different from the ones I have previously reviewed, as this one tested my ability to take a scenario and “translate” it into pseudo code. While the scenario given was pretty basic, which made it relatively easy to choose the correct answer, it is important that I try to find more practice problems like this, as the real AP Exam could give a much more challenging questions. While doing this is not challenging, if I ended up misinterpreting the scenario, I could have gone down the wrong path searching for the answer and thus choose the wrong answer. It is important that I learn to familiarize myself with these kinds of questions by maybe finding some online or putting emphasis on these kinds of questions to review for the AP exam, as that will definitely put me on the path to doing well. . Final Reflection/Personal Takeaways . Overall, I am very happy with the score that I earned, as it shows that I have a good understanding of what we have studied in this class so far and shows me that I can answer multiple choice questions like these really well. The questions that I reviewed here were also a learning experience for me, as it made me realize how I can approach those kinds of questions in the future to ensure that I reduce the risk of getting them wrong. I like having these opportunities to test myself on what we have learned so far and seeing how well I do, as they almost always are a true learning experience for me. These kinds of tests show me what my strengths and weaknesses are and tell me how I can improve, and I really hope that I reflect great improvement in answering MCQ questions as we continue to do more of them in the future leading up to the AP exam. .",

For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. | Condition - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop. | increment/decrement - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition. | Indexing / List Index - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 | append, remove, pop - Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item. | Elements [in a list] - An item in a list. | Nesting - Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. | array - Another name for a list, depends on the language | Key - the unique identifier associated with a value in a dictionary, such as name | Value - the data associated with a key in a dictionary, such as age | Pair - a key-value combination in a dictionary, such as a person&#39;s name + age | Mutable - the ability to be changed or modified | Tuple - an immutable ordered sequence of elements, similar to a list | Insertion - the process of adding a new key-value pair to a dictionary | Deletion - the process of removing a key-value pair from a dictionary | Keys method/keys() - a built-in Python function that returns a list of all keys in a dictionary | Values method/values() - a built-in Python function that returns a list of all values in a dictionary | Items method/items() - a built-in Python function that returns a list of all key-value pairs in a dictionary as tuples | Update method/update() - a built-in Python function that updates a dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary or iterable | Clear method/clear() - a built-in Python function that removes all key-value pairs from a dictionary | . Questions: . Give an example of iteration. | One example of iteration is binary search, as the program has to go through/iterate through a list in order to find a target value. The maximum number of times or guesses it takes to find the number in the list is 2^n. For example, if an element had 82 elements, it would take a maximum of 2^7 (128) times to find the number, since 2^6 (64) would not be enough. . What is the difference between a for loop and while loop? That is, when would you use a for loop and when would you use a while loop? | A for loop repeats a fixed number of times while a while loop repeats as many times as is necessary until a condition is met. You would you use a for loop if you want the program to iterate through a list the same number of times as there are elements. You would use a while loop if you want the program to keep going while a certain condition is true. . In the APCSP AP exam, what number do indexes start with? important to know | In the APCSP exam, the indexes start with the number 1, which literally makes zero sense dsajkghfyskfyaedfgaidvdciyadgfiyasvblf. . Are dictionaries and lists mutable? | Yes, lists and dictionaries are mutable. With dictionaries, you can add, modify, or even remove key-value pairs even after they have been created. . Simulations/Interactions . Building a simulation o#r interaction using lists and iteration in VS Code can be accomplished using a few simple steps: . Define your data: First, you need to define the data that your simulation will be working with. This could be a list of numbers, a list of strings, or any other type of data that your simulation will be manipulating. . | Write your simulation code: Once you have defined your data, you can start writing the code for your simulation. This code will typically involve iterating over your list of data, performing some operation on each item in the list, and updating the list accordingly. . | Test your simulation: After you have written your simulation code, it is important to test it to make sure it is working as expected. You can do this by running your code and checking the output to see if it matches what you expect. . | Refine your simulation: Once you have tested your simulation, you may need to refine it based on the results. This could involve tweaking the code to make it more efficient, adding new features, or fixing any bugs that you have discovered. . | Why use simulations? . Simulations can be useful because they can emulate real world situations without needing excessive resources (ex: money), time, or equipment. For example, a simulation of the effectiveness of a new seatbelt or airbag can be performed by simulating car crashes. This would be better than doing it in real life because you wouldn&#39;t want to place people in cars and then crash them for obvious reasons. | However, simulatins do assume things about the real world and can have biases. They can be oversimplified because the real world often has more complications and factors that can affect something. In the case of our car crash simulation, other things can have a big impact, such as the weather and experience of the driver. However, these things can sometimes be held constant in the simulations. | . Questions: . Explain an example of something you could simulate | One thing that I could simulate is an airplane flying from one airport to another using a variety of flight simulators that are available. I can change different variables such as the weather to see how an airplane would respond as it makes the route to its destination. . Why are simulations useful and important? | Simulations are useful and important because they are very cost-efficient, meaning that we don&#39;t have to spend as much money on simulations as we do if we want to test something in real life. Additionally, simulations provide us with a realistic view of the real world and can be used to help make important decisions. . Here&#39;s a simple example of a simulation in Python that uses lists and iteration to calculate the average of a list of numbers: . numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # Initialize the sum and count variables sum = 0 count = 0 # Iterate over the list of numbers, adding each number to the sum for number in numbers: sum += number count += 1 # Calculate the average of the list of numbers average = sum / count # Print the average print(&quot;The average of the list is:&quot;, average) . The average of the list is: 3.0 . This code defines a list of numbers, iterates over the list to calculate the sum and count of the numbers, and then calculates the average by dividing the sum by the count. Finally, it prints the average to the console. . Lists . Iteration statements can be used to traverse a list | Knowldege of exisiting algorithms that use iteration can help in constructing new algorithms. Some are: Determining a minimum or maximum value in a list | Computing a sum or average of a list of numbers | . | . What are Lists? . Lists are a collection of multiple elements. | Each sequence is demarcated with an index, starting from 0. This is known as base 0 indexing | In memory, it is stored as a variable name with multiple pointers to each variable stored in a certain order | Lists can also be called arrays | Lists have methods that act upon the list and change them. This moves the pointers within RAM to change the parts of the list. | . Nested Lists . Uses of Nested lists . Placing lists within lists allows you to have arrays of similar data together, and create complexity. . Some uses include: . Creating 2d Arrays | Storing similar, but slightly different categories (sublists) | Create a matrix | . Iteration . Iterative statements are also called while loops, and they repeat themselves over and over until the condition for stopping is met. . In College Board&#39;s Pseudocode, the first is a REPEAT n TIMES loop, where the n represents some number. | . The second type of loop is a REPEAT UNTIL (condition) loop, where the loop will continue to run until a condition is met. . Conceptually, a while loop is very similar to an if conditional, except that a while is continually executed until it&#39;s no longer true and an if is only executed once. . Questions: . Describe a situation where you would need iteration. | One situation where you would need iteration is binary search, as it requires one to iterate through a sorted list of elements in order to find the target value. . Describe the difference between a &quot;REPEAT n TIMES&quot; loop VS a &quot;REPEAT UNTIL (condition)&quot; loop. it is important you know this for the AP Exam | REPEAT n TIMES describes a loop that is supposed to repeat itself a fixed and already predetermined number of times, while a REPEAT UNTIL (condition) loop describes a loop that needs to repeat itself as many times as necessary until the condition for stopping is met (it is not already predetermined) . Libaries . A software library contains procedures that may be used in creating new programs. | Existing code segments can come from internal or external sources, such as libaries or previously written code. | The use of libaries simplifies the task of creating complex programs. | . APIs . Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a libary behave and can be used as documentation for an API/libary is necessary in understanding the behaviors provided by the API and how to use them. . A file that contains procedures that can be used in a program is considered a libary. . API provides specifications for how procedures in a library behave and can be used. | Many companies use APIs for programmers to interact with their products. | . Questions: . What are some libraries that we&#39;ve learned about? What are their advantages/disadvantages? | Some libraries that we have learned about include pandas, numpy, math, turtle, and many more. Some of their advantages are that we can use commands associated with that library, and some of their disadvantages include the fact that they can only do so much. . Dictionaries . What are Dictionaries? . an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is assigned and associated with a specific value | known as associative arrays, maps, or hash tables in some programming languages | used to store and retrieve data efficiently, as they allow fast access to values based on their associated keys | useful for a wide range of tasks, such as storing, indexing, and counting | . What are the types of Dictionaries? . Ordered Dictionaries . Iterates over keys and values in the same order that the keys were inserted | If an entry is deleted and reinserted, then it will be moved to the end of the dictionary | Specially designed to keep its items ordered | Useful in situations where the order of insertion is important and when you need to process data in a specific order | If the order of the data is important, an ordered dictionary is the better choice | . How to create an ordered dictionary? . Import OrderedDict from collections | Create an empty ordered dictionary by instantiating OrderedDict without providing arguments to the constructor | Add key-value pairs to the dictionary by providing a key in square brackets ([]) and assigning a value to that key. | Print the ordered dictionary | Iterate over the items in the ordered dictionary | Regular Dictionaries . Mutable; can add, remove, and modify key-value pairs after they have been created | Used to store data values in key:value pairs | Can be iterated over using loops | If order is not important, a regular dictionary may provide better performance | . How to create a regular dictionary? . Create a variable name which will be the name of the dictionary | Assign the variable to an empty set of curly braces {} | Create a dictionary with the dict() OR empty curly brackets | Questions: . Compare and contrast lists and dictionaries. | Dictionaries have keys that are assigned to specific values while lists do not. . Do dictionary keys need to be unique? | Yes, dictionary keys need to be unique. . folklore_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Folklore&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2020, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Alternative/Indie&quot;, &quot;Pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: [&quot;the 1&quot;, 7], 2: [&quot;cardigan&quot;, 9], 3: [&quot;the last great american dynasty&quot;, 7], 4: [&quot;exile (ft.

List before reverse : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Similar to insertion sort, this algorithm takes an unsorted array and returns a sorted array. Unlike insertion sort where you iterate through the each element and move the smaller elements to the front, this algorithm starts at the beginning and swaps the position of every element in the array . list = [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] print(f&quot;array before sort {list}&quot;) def insertion_sort(list): for index in range(1,len(list)): # repeats through length of the array value = list[index] i = index - 1 while i &gt;= 0: if value &lt; list[i]: list[i+1] = list[i] # shift number in slot i to the right list[i] = value # shift value left into slot i i = i - 1 else: break IS = insertion_sort(list) # print(f&quot;array after sort {list}&quot;) . array before sort [9, 8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 0] .

Sorting Algorithm on Dictionary/List . num_list = [3,11,6,1,5,10,8,4,0,2,7] def bubble_sort(num_list): n = len(num_list) for i in range(n): already_sorted = True for j in range(n - i - 1): if num_list[j] &gt; num_list[j + 1]: num_list[j], num_list[j + 1] = num_list[j + 1], num_list[j] already_sorted = False if already_sorted: break return num_list bubble_sort(num_list) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11] . Explanation in Words . The bubble sorting algorithm, just like any other sorting algorithm, has to iterate through the list in order to output the list ordered from least to greatest. For the bubble sorting algorithm specifically, it compares two numbers (one left and one right). If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, the sorting algorithm will switch the two and &quot;bubbles&quot; the smaller number to the beginning of the list so that it more accurately represents the list from least to greatest. If the number on the right is greater than the number on the left, the numbers are kept where they are. The bubble sorting algorithm repeats this process until the entire list is sorted from least to greatest. While the bubble sorting algorithm may not have the best time complexity (which is O(n^2)), personally, I have found myself being able to understand and code the bubble sorting algorithm the best. . Simulation Code with a List (Calculator) . def get_data(): print( &quot;Welcome to the data set calculator! Here you can input a set of data and find out all sorts of information about it!&quot; ) complete = False while not complete: # the program will continue to ask the user to input data points while this is true try: data = float(input(&quot;Enter a data point: &quot;)) data_set.append(data) except: print(&quot;Invalid input.

Further Explanation of Above Code . The above code segment is a calculator that allows the user to find multiple statistical information about their data set. It allows them to input any number that they would like (positive, negative, decimal) and as many numbers as they would like until they type in &quot;n&quot; to indicate that they would like to stop entering data points. It uses a list called data_set, which is where all of the user&#39;s inputs is stored. The calculator uses two algorithms: one bubble sorting algorithm and one algorithm that calculates the mode of the data set. The bubble sorting algorithm (just as its name says) sorts the list of numbers that the user has inputted from least to greatest. This way, once the user has finished inputting all of their data points, they will be provided with both lists of numbers (one that lists them in the order the user entered them, one that lists them from least to greatest). The other algorithm, called mode, uses a dictionary that relates the numbers in the list to the number of times that they appear in the list. The &quot;number&quot; represents the key and the &quot;count&quot; represents the value of the dictionary. If the number that the user adds is already in the list, one will be added to the value &quot;count&quot;, and if the number the user adds is n ot already in the list, the value &quot;count&quot; will be set equal to 1. If a number appears a higher number of times than the previously assigned mode did, the mode will be set to that new number and will be displayed in the output as the mode of the list. . This calculator demonstrates everything that we have learned this lesson, which includes simulations, interactions, lists, dictionaries, and sorting algorithms. This can be considered a simulation because the program can simulate a real-life scientific calculator and can also be used to perform multiple calculations on the data set. The calculator also has the list data_set as described above as well as the dictionary named occurrences with the key-value pair also being described above. The calculator is also interactive in that it allows the user to input whichever numbers that they want to, whether it is a ridiculously large number or a random decimal number. Finally, the calculator also includes a sorting algorithm, as it uses the bubble sorting algorithm in order to sort the data set into a list that is easier to understand since it goes from least to greatest. . Overall, while I was unable to implement UI into this simulation, I believe that it is still worthy of earning the extra 0.1 points, as it can actually be used for data entry from something such as a study or experiment involving numbers. For example, a teacher could use this calculator to input entries for scores that students earned on a math test. By allowing the teacher to calculate the mean, median, and mode score for the class, they can draw several conclusions about things such as their teaching style and adjust it accordingly so that the results obtained are improved for the next time they use the calculator. .",

            "content": "Overview . This blog shows some of the questions that I either got wrong or forced me to think about the answer for a little while before getting it right. It also goes into detail on questions I got wrong and what I can do better to not make that same mistake on a question like that for the future. . My Score . The final exam was 66 questions for a grand total of 67 points. I earned a score of 65/67 (97%), as shown below: . My score indicates that I have a very solid understanding of all the concepts on the exam; however, there were a few questions that I got wrong and would like to go over as well as questions that forced me to think for a while before I arrived at the correct answer. It is important that I review these questions, as I will know how to tackle these questions at a much faster pace when I take the actual AP exam. . Questions to Review . Questions I got wrong . Question 32 . The first question to review is question 32, shown below: . . The correct answer was D, which is shown in the image of the question. Question 32 involved figuring out which pseudocode segment could be used to calculate the finalGrade using the procedure calls given in the table. While the concept behind this question was not particularly difficult, I ended up getting this question wrong, as I likely assumed that by subtracting the smallest of the scores in the list of scores that it would also drop the lowest score. This caused me to choose C, which divided the sum after subtracting the lowest score by the length of the list before the lowest score was moved, which was incorrect. I now know that I should carefully read what is on the code segment, as not doing so here is what caused me to get this exact question wrong. For a question like this, I need to make sure that I look at the important parts of each choice and to not overthink it, as doing so could make me lose valuable time and in fact make it more likely for me to choose the wrong answer. . Question 67 . The next question to review is question 67, shown below: . . This question had two correct answers, which were A and B as shown above. I chose A as one of the answers, but I ended up choosing C instead of B for the second answer, resulting in me getting the question wrong. For this question, I had to keep track of everything that was happening as the procedure NumOccurences iterated through wordList. I was able to successfully do this for A, as I could see that the count of “birch” would be increased to one the first time that it was seen before count would be reset to 0 after moving on to the next work. For the other choice, however, I failed to see that option C would display the intended result, since the word oak is the last element of the list and only occurs once, displaying the result 1. B is the other correct answer because while “count” for the word maple becomes 1 the first time it is equal to the targetWord, the count resets after moving on to the word “oak”, which causes the program to display 0 as the result instead of 1. This is why I believe that this question will be an especially important one to review while we study for the AP exam. One way I can improve my confidence with questions like these is to write down what is happening rather than just trying to do everything in my head, as if I do it in my head, I will be more likely to make a mistake. . Questions I got right but took me some time to answer . Question 26 . The next question to review is question 26, shown below: . . The correct answer to this question was A, which was the missing code shown above While the concept behind this question was not particularly difficult, similar to the last question reviewed, I had to keep track of what was happening and where the robot was on the grid. Whether the robot had to move forward or rotate right, I needed to make sure that I noted down where the robot was and imagine what it would like if the robot were to rotate in a certain direction. As previously mentioned, one way I can improve my ability to answer these questions with more confidence is to perhaps write or even draw out what is happening, as I know that we will be provided with some paper for the AP exam. While it may not be necessary, especially for a computer science class, I have sometimes found it helpful when I write stuff down, as I can clearly see what is happening and am more easily able to pick the correct answer. . Question 38 . The last question to review is question 38, shown below: . . The correct answer for this question was C, which is highlighted in green above. This question is quite different from the ones I have previously reviewed, as this one tested my ability to take a scenario and “translate” it into pseudo code. While the scenario given was pretty basic, which made it relatively easy to choose the correct answer, it is important that I try to find more practice problems like this, as the real AP Exam could give a much more challenging questions. While doing this is not challenging, if I ended up misinterpreting the scenario, I could have gone down the wrong path searching for the answer and thus choose the wrong answer. It is important that I learn to familiarize myself with these kinds of questions by maybe finding some online or putting emphasis on these kinds of questions to review for the AP exam, as that will definitely put me on the path to doing well. . Question 56 . The last question to review is question 56, shown below: . . The correct answer for this question was D, which is that the program displays odd integers from 1 to 19. Similar to some of the questions that I have reviewed for this exam and other exams we have completed in the past, the tricky part of this question was that I had to keep track of everything that was going on. For this particular question, I had to note down the sums as well as any patterns in terms of if all of the results were odd or even While doing this is not challenging, if I added wrong or lost track of what was happening, I would end up 1. losing valuable time and 2. risk getting the question wrong. It is important that I learn to familiarize myself with these kinds of questions by practicing more questions like these for the AP exam, as that will definitely put me on the path to doing well. . Final Reflection/Personal Takeaways . Overall, I am very happy with the score that I earned, as it shows that I have a good understanding of what we have studied in this class so far and shows me that I can answer multiple choice questions like these really well. The questions that I reviewed here were also a learning experience for me, as it made me realize how I can approach those kinds of questions in the future to ensure that I reduce the risk of getting them wrong. I like having these opportunities to test myself on what we have learned so far and seeing how well I do, as they almost always are a true learning experience for me. These kinds of tests show me what my strengths and weaknesses are and tell me how I can improve, and I really hope that I reflect great improvement in answering MCQ questions as we continue to do more of them in the future leading up to the AP exam. .",

            "content": "KASM Hacks . (1) In 3-4 sentences, please explain the significance of virtual desktops and KASM. How can virtual desktops such as these be utilized in our AP CSP environment? (0.45) . KASM Workspaces essentially allows us to stream applications from containers (for our class, Docker containers with the “make server” command). KASM is very versatile in terms of its functionality, as you can get access desktop access in a small amount of time from any device and anywhere around the world. Furthermore, KASM has many advantages to its functionality, one being that it is very scalable. Another great thing about KASM is that it is very easy to access, as the web browser that you log in from doesn’t matter and whatever you are deploying can be hosted anywhere. Another perk of KASM, which is probably the most important, is that it has very well-managed security, with 2 factor authentication (2FA), security groups, logging, and web filtering. Overall, KASM Workspaces has many great functionalities and is definitely a very efficient way of hosting applications, especially for a class like CSP. . (2) Attempt to work through the KASM setup with your team. Attach two screenshots to show that you have successfully gone through the setup: The first screenshot of KASM generating your credentials, and the second screenshot of the KASM workspace once you have logged in.

D. To showcase how to insert data into a MySQL table. . Answer: C . Answers: C,A,C . DuckDNS and AWS Hacks . HACK 1: Create a diagram (Canva). What are the pros and cons of using DuckDNS? Show a diagram of an application running on AWS using a DuckDNS system. . Pros of using DuckDNS: . It’s a free domain service that allows users to assign a domain name specific to their website | It allows us to access a device or service using a static hostname, which is far more convenient | It uses HTTPS encryption to protect user data. | It can be used to create custom domain names for your network. | . Cons of using DuckDNS: . Relies on the stability of your internet connection, so if connection drops, one cannot access their network remotely | It may not be suitable for larger or more complex networks or devices that require more advanced features | . . HACK 2: Write a reflection. Why do we use DNS? How does DuckDNS work? What makes DuckDNS unique? How is DuckDNS useful for our projects? What are the steps to setup DuckDNS? . DuckDNS is a free dynamic DNS service that allows users to assign a domain name to a dynamic IP address It works by automatically updating the DNS records for a custom domain name that one chooses, such as “mywebsite.duckdns.org”, with the current IP address of their home network. This means that even if one’s ISP assigns their IP address, they can still access their home network using the same domain name. DuckDNS is unique in that it is a free and easy-to-use service and can be used to create custom domain names for your network, which sharply contrasts with other DNS services such as Freenom, which requires people to pay money at times. It’s useful for projects that require remote access to a home network, such as running a personal web server (i.e. our Flask Python Web Application) or accessing home automation devices. To set up DuckDNS, you need to… . (1) Sign in with your DuckDNS account by selecting “Sign in with Github” (2) Creating a subdomain by entering a unique name and clicking the “add domain” button (3) Under “current ip”, change the IP address into the IP address that you would like to access (ex. the public IP address on the class EC2 instance) (4) After entering the IP address to be whatever you want, click the “update ip” button to confirm the change (5) Now you can use your unique DuckDNS subdomain to access your web application from the Internet! . HACK 4: In 2-3 complete sentences, talk about any outdated Nginx/Docker functionalities that may need to be addressed or any confusions you may have in regards to the deployment process from Trimesters 1 and 2. . While I currently do not have any confusions in regards to the deployment process from Trimesters 1 and 2 (as someone who did it both trimesters), I do remember some things that were especially confusing to me as I was learning about it and making progress on it over time. For example, I would have a difficult time understanding the difference between the nginx sites-enabled directory and the nginx sites-available directory, and I used to think that they were just the same file contents but with a different file name, so I assumed that the steps could be applied to either file. However, I learned that this was not the case the hard way, as our web application ended up not working and I had to redo the entire deployment process from scratch. Another thing that was especially confusing to me was that sometimes, in the nginx directories, there would be files that had a red colored font to them, and they would appear over and over again even after deleting them each time. This was obviously due to the fact that everyone was using the same EC2 instance, so as other groups were working on the deployment process, the red file would end up showing up for all of the groups. . HACK 5: Create a Venn Diagram comparing Nginx with Lighttpd. . . HACK 6: Complete the Python quiz and attach your output from the notebook (should be done once you do the quiz.) .

(1) Follow the instructions below and provide a full screenshot of all terminal commands after and including sudo certbot –apache all the way until it asks for the domain you want to secure. At this point you can take a screenshot and cancel the process. If you choose to continue the setup process and get Certbot fully working and show a before and after screenshot of your domain with http amd https connection we will grant extra credit points on hacks, or make up for lost points in other areas. . Attempt at getting it to work: . . (2) Research and compare the security features of OpenSSL and LibreSSL, and write about the recent vulnerabilities within it. Write about your research in a fastpages blog post. It can be the same post that has your screenshot for the Certbot Hacks. . OpenSSL and LibreSSL are both open-source implementations of the SSL and TLS protocols, which are used to encrypt and secure data communications over the internet. . OpenSSL: . Supports a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, including AES, RSA, and SHA | Has a robust security audit process and is regularly updated to address any security issues found | Offers a variety of security options, such as secure random number generation, certificate validation, and OCSP stapling | . LibreSSL: . Created in response to a number of security issues found in OpenSSL in 2014 | Strives to be a more secure and reliable version of OpenSSL, with a focus on removing old code | Offers improved security features, such as memory allocation hardening, safer curve selection, and a stricter codebase | . While OpenSSL and LibreSSL have their very fascinating and important security features, they have both have recently had their share of vulnerabilities. . For example, with OpenSSL 3.0-3.0.6 (released in September 2021), two quite recent vulnerabilities that have erupted are the CVE-2022-3786 and CVE-2022-3602 vulnerabilities that involve email address buffer overflow and forces users to upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0. One very recent vulnerability in the LibreSSL took place a few weeks ago, called CVE-2022-48437. According to the description of the vulnerability, it entailed “[a]n issue” that “was discovered in x509/x509_verify.c in LibreSSL before 3.6.1, and in OpenBSD before 7.2 errata 001. x509_verify_ctx_add_chain does not store errors that occur during leaf certificate verification, and therefore an incorrect error is returned. This behavior occurs when there is an installed verification callback that instructs the verifier to continue upon detecting an invalid certificate.” . In summary, OpenSSL and LibreSSL are both widely used and respected implementations of SSL/TLS protocols, offering a range of security features to protect data communications. However, like any software, they are not 100% immune to vulnerabilities despite these security measures, and it is important to stay up to date with the latest security updates to ensure the safe use of computer systems in our daily lives. .",

            "title": "MCQ Test 4 Review",
            "content": "Overview . This blog shows some of the questions that I either got wrong or forced me to think about the answer for a little while before getting it right. It also goes into detail on questions I got wrong and what I can do better to not make that same mistake on a question like that for the future. . My Score . The final exam was 66 questions for a grand total of 66 points. I earned a score of 66/66 (100%), as shown below: . My score indicates that I have a very solid understanding of all the concepts on the exam; however, there were a few questions that forced me to think for a while before I arrived at the correct answer. Even though I did not get any questions wrong, it is important that I review questions that took forced me to think for a while, as I will know how to tackle these questions at a much faster pace when I take the actual AP exam. . Questions to Review . Question 10 . The first question to review is question 10, shown below: . . The correct answer was B, which is shown in the image of the question. Question 10 involved figuring out which procedure could be used to draw the circles shown in the image. While the concept behind this question was not particularly difficult, I had to keep track of where the units were as I was shifting the x and y position. Had I lost track while doing this process, I could have chosen the wrong answer. For a question like this, I need to make sure that I look for only the important parts of the table and to not overthink it, as doing so could make me lose valuable time and in fact make it more likely for me to choose the wrong answer. . Question 21 . The next question to review is question 21, shown below: . . The correct answer was B, which was the code segments shown above. Even though I chose the correct answer, this question took me some time to do as I had to keep track of where the robot was as multiple operations were performed on it. Had I lost track of the position of the robot, I could have made a mistake in identifying what would bring the robot to the gray square, which could have led me to the wrong answer. This is why I believe that this question will be an especially important one to review while we study for the AP exam. One way I can improve my confidence with questions like these is to write down what is happening rather than just trying to do everything in my head, as if I do it in my head, I will be more likely to make a mistake. . Question 26 . The next question to review is question 26, shown below: . . The correct answer to this question was A, which was the missing code shown above While the concept behind this question was not particularly difficult, similar to the last question reviewed, I had to keep track of what was happening and where the robot was on the grid. Whether the robot had to move forward or rotate right, I needed to make sure that I noted down where the robot was and imagine what it would like if the robot were to rotate in a certain direction. As previously mentioned, one way I can improve my ability to answer these questions with more confidence is to perhaps write or even draw out what is happening, as I know that we will be provided with some paper for the AP exam. While it may not be necessary, especially for a computer science class, I have sometimes found it helpful when I write stuff down, as I can clearly see what is happening and am more easily able to pick the correct answer. . Question 38 . The last question to review is question 38, shown below: . . The correct answer for this question was C, which is highlighted in green above. This question is quite different from the ones I have previously reviewed, as this one tested my ability to take a scenario and “translate” it into pseudo code. While the scenario given was pretty basic, which made it relatively easy to choose the correct answer, it is important that I try to find more practice problems like this, as the real AP Exam could give a much more challenging questions. While doing this is not challenging, if I ended up misinterpreting the scenario, I could have gone down the wrong path searching for the answer and thus choose the wrong answer. It is important that I learn to familiarize myself with these kinds of questions by maybe finding some online or putting emphasis on these kinds of questions to review for the AP exam, as that will definitely put me on the path to doing well. . Question 56 . The last question to review is question 56, shown below: . . The correct answer for this question was D, which is that the program displays odd integers from 1 to 19. Similar to some of the questions that I have reviewed for this exam and other exams we have completed in the past, the tricky part of this question was that I had to keep track of everything that was going on. For this particular question, I had to note down the sums as well as any patterns in terms of if all of the results were odd or even While doing this is not challenging, if I added wrong or lost track of what was happening, I would end up 1. losing valuable time and 2. risk getting the question wrong. It is important that I learn to familiarize myself with these kinds of questions by practicing more questions like these for the AP exam, as that will definitely put me on the path to doing well. . Final Reflection/Personal Takeaways . Overall, I am very happy with the score that I earned, as it shows that I have a good understanding of what we have studied in this class so far and shows me that I can answer multiple choice questions like these really well. The questions that I reviewed here were also a learning experience for me, as it made me realize how I can approach those kinds of questions in the future to ensure that I reduce the risk of getting them wrong. I like having these opportunities to test myself on what we have learned so far and seeing how well I do, as they almost always are a true learning experience for me. These kinds of tests show me what my strengths and weaknesses are and tell me how I can improve, and I really hope that I reflect great improvement in answering MCQ questions as we continue to do more of them in the future leading up to the AP exam. .",

            "title": "Time Complexities and Sorting Algorithms Review",
            "content": "Overview of This Blog . Over the past few weeks through tech talks, we have learned about what time complexity is and why it is important as we construct algorithms. Some time complexities are faster (ex. O(n), O(1)), while some add much more time for each extra step or element of a list (ex. O(n^2), O(2^n), etc.). There are also various kinds of sorting algorithms, with some being more efficient than others. This blog serves to review all of these concepts to allow one to get a quick recap of everything that we have learned so far in Data Structures 1. . Time Complexities . Constant: O(1) . This kind of time complexity is probably the easiest one to understand. Constant time complexity is an algorithm that takes the same amount of time to execute regardless of the number of inputs/elements of the list. For example, if we wanted to find the fourth element of a list of numbers, we can do so as shown in the code below: . num_list = [17,29,42,69,100,206] # list of numbers print(num_list[3]) . 69 . We could make the list smaller or larger, but it will not change the amount of time that it takes to execute the program. . Linear: O(n) . Linear time complexity is when the time it takes for an algorithm to execute increase linearly with the number of inputs/elements of a list used. For this time complexity and the rest of the ones below, the amount of inputs used does matter, unlike the constant time algorithm. For example, if we wanted to iterate through a list of numbers to check if they are greater than a certain value and to print only those numbers, the more elements that we use, the longer the program will take to execute. . num_list = [10,37,82,99,150,111,69420,525] def display(): for num in num_list: if num &gt; 100 and num &lt; 1000: print(num) display() . 150 111 525 . While the difference in time is not visible (since the list is only 8 elements), the larger and larger we make this list, the more time that it will take for the computer to iterate through each number of the list to see which ones are greater than 100 but less than 100. . Quadratic: O(n^2) . O(n^2) time complexity is an algorithm in which the time that it takes to execute increases by the number of inputs added squared. For example, if the input array/list has 10 elements, it will do 100 operations. If the input array/list has 2 elements, will do 4 operations, and if the list has 10 elements, it will do 100 operations, and so on. Clearly, this kind of time complexity is not the most efficient, as it adds a lot more operations and therefore execution time for each extra element. . num_list = [16,102,301] n = len(num_list) for i in range(0,n): for j in range(0,n): print(j) . 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 . As you can see, the outer loop containing &quot;i&quot; will run 3 times since there are 3 elements in the list. However, since we also have a nested for loop within that loop (j), the inner loop will also run 3 times, thus printing out the length of the list from 0 to 2 3 times (9 operations). Even though it may not look like a big difference now, if we continue to increase the size of the list, it will get to the point in which we will lose all patience because of how long it will take. . Logarithmic: O(logn) . Logarithmic time complexity is probably one of the more faster time complexities of the ones mentioned so far (behind constant). With logarithmic time complexity, as the input/list size became bigger, the number of operations (i.e. time) grows very slowly, with n representing the number of elements. For example, one could show a binary search algorithm to demonstrate logarithmic time complexity, as shown below: . def binary_search(num_list, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 if num_list[mid] == x: return mid elif num_list[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 num_list = [12,100,203,532,69420,102710] x = int(input(&quot;Enter any number from the number list: 12,100,203,532,69420,102710&quot;)) print(f&#39;You inputted {x}&#39;) result = binary_search(num_list, x, 0, len(num_list)-1) if result != -1: print(f&#39;{x} is present at index {result}&#39;) else: print(f&#39;{x} is not present&#39;) . You inputted 532 532 is present at index 3 . It is also worth noting that the number of times that the program has to iterate through the program to find x is equal to the log base 2 of the closest next power of 2 to the length of the list. In this case, since the length of the list was 6, log base 2 of 6 is closest to 3, therefore the program had to guess 3 times before arriving at x, which was 532 here. . Exponential: O(2^n) . Exponential time complexity is probably something you can imagine. As the number of elements n increases, the number of operations performed (i.e. time) increases exponentially. Obviously, this kind of time complexity is highly inefficient, as for every one new element, the time increases dramatically compared to linear or quadratic. One example of an exponential time complexity program is a program that finds the number of possible permutations of a list of numbers, as demonstrated below: . import itertools num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4] permutations = itertools.permutations(num_list) for i in permutations: print(i) . (1, 2, 3, 4) (1, 2, 4, 3) (1, 3, 2, 4) (1, 3, 4, 2) (1, 4, 2, 3) (1, 4, 3, 2) (2, 1, 3, 4) (2, 1, 4, 3) (2, 3, 1, 4) (2, 3, 4, 1) (2, 4, 1, 3) (2, 4, 3, 1) (3, 1, 2, 4) (3, 1, 4, 2) (3, 2, 1, 4) (3, 2, 4, 1) (3, 4, 1, 2) (3, 4, 2, 1) (4, 1, 2, 3) (4, 1, 3, 2) (4, 2, 1, 3) (4, 2, 3, 1) (4, 3, 1, 2) (4, 3, 2, 1) . As we increase the number of inputs in the number list, the program will take more and more time to generate the list of all possible permutations of the original list. . Sorting Algorithms . Sorting algorithms are algorithms that take a large list of items and puts them into a specific order. For example, with a list of numbers, a sorting algorithm may sort the list of numbers from highest to lowest or lowest to highest. The next code segments all fulfill the same purpose but by different means of doing so with different time complexities. . Bubble Sort Algorithm: O(n^2) . The bubble sorting algorithm is an algorithm that compares two consecutive elements of a list. If the two elements (example numbers) are in the right order, nothing needs to be changed. If the numbers are not in the right order, however, they will then be swapped so that the smaller numbers can be &quot;bubbled&quot; to the top of the list. . num_list = [3,11,6,1,5,10,8,4,0,2,7] def bubble_sort(num_list): n = len(num_list) for i in range(n): already_sorted = True for j in range(n - i - 1): if num_list[j] &gt; num_list[j + 1]: num_list[j], num_list[j + 1] = num_list[j + 1], num_list[j] already_sorted = False if already_sorted: break return num_list bubble_sort(num_list) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11] . Bubble sort gets the job done of sorting the list; however, it does have an average time complexity of O(n^2), meaning that the number of operations performed will get larger and larger as the list in question gets larger and larger. Thus, even though bubble sort is one of the more simpler algorithms to understand, it may not be the best option when it comes to sorting. . Merge Sort Algorithm: O(nlogn) . With the merge sorting algorithm, the algorithm takes one array and splits it in half. For each half of the array, the algorithm rearranges the array so that the elements are in the desired order. Once that has been done successfully, the algorithm merges the two arrays/lists back together so that the desired order is achieved for the entire array/list. . def merge_sort(arr): if len(arr) &lt;= 1: return arr mid = len(arr) // 2 left_half = arr[:mid] right_half = arr[mid:] left_half = merge_sort(left_half) right_half = merge_sort(right_half) return merge(left_half, right_half) def merge(left_half, right_half): result = [] i, j = 0, 0 while i &lt; len(left_half) and j &lt; len(right_half): if left_half[i] &lt;= right_half[j]: result.append(left_half[i]) i += 1 else: result.append(right_half[j]) j += 1 result += left_half[i:] result += right_half[j:] return result num_list = [3,11,6,1,5,10,8,4,0,2,7] merge_sort(num_list) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11] . Merge sort, just like bubble sort, is also another way of sorting a list back into the desired order. However, merge sort is better than bubble sort in terms of time complexity, with merge sort having an average time complexity of O(nlogn). This means that the amount of operations performed will not be as large as the input size increases for a merge sort algorithm as it would be for a bubble sorting algorithm. . Reflection . I created this blog to help remind myself of the differing time complexities and where they would fall in terms of least efficient to most efficient. However, after completing the blog, I hope that it will not only serve as a study tool for myself, but also for other students taking the APCSP exam in May, as I would want anyone who is also in my position to have something like this quickly recap everything that we have learned so far in this class. Furthermore, understanding the different time complexities and sorting algorithms is probably going to be an important concept for College Board, which is why I added some explanations to all of the code segments that I included so that I or someone else viewing this can understand what is going on. .",

            "content": "Overview . This blog shows some of the questions that I either got wrong or forced me to think about the answer for a little while before getting it right. It also goes into detail on questions I got wrong and what I can do better to not make that same mistake on a question like that for the future. . My Score . The final exam was 50 questions for a grand total of 50 points. I earned a score of 50/50 (100%), as shown below: . My score indicates that I have a very solid understanding of all the concepts on the exam; however, there were a few questions that forced me to think for a while before I arrived at the correct answer. . Questions to Review . Question 24 . The first question to review is question 24, shown below: . . The correct answer was D, which was that sorting data would take the most amount of time with 100,000 customers. While I did choose the right answer, I had to carefully look at the data and figure out what the time complexities for each task was, as that way, I could figure out a pattern and conclude what the times for each task would be for 100,000 customers. I could easily eliminate choices A, B, C, thus making D the correct answer. For a question like this, I need to make sure that I look for only the important parts of the table and to not overthink it, as doing so could make me lose valuable time and in fact make it more likely for me to choose the wrong answer. . Question 25 . The next question to review is question 25, shown below: . . The correct answer was C, which was that the ASCII character J could be represented by the binary number listed in the question Even though I chose the correct answer, this question took me some time to do as I had to keep track of what was going on as I converted the base 2 number into base 10. Had I lost track of what was going on, I could have chosen the wrong answer, which is why I believe that this question will be an especially important one to review when we being studying for the AP exams. One way I can improve my confidence with questions like these is to write down what is happening rather than just trying to do everything in my head, as if I do it in my head, I will be more likely to make a mistake. . Question 39 . The next question to review is question 39, shown below: . . The correct answer to this question was D, which was that 1 3 2 4 cannot be displayed from executing the code segment. While the concept behind this question was not particularly difficult, similar to the last question reviewed, I had to keep track of everything that was happening to each variable. Whether the number 1 or 2 was chosen, I needed to make sure that I noted down which numbers could be chosen depending on what the endpoint i was. As previously mentioned, one way I can improve my ability to answer these questions with more confidence is to perhaps write it down, as I know that we will be provided with some paper for the AP exam. While it may not be necessary, especially for a computer science class, I have sometimes found it helpful when I write stuff down, as I can clearly see what is happening and am more easily able to pick the correct answer. . Question 45 . The last question to review is question 45, shown below: . . The correct answer for this question was B, which is highlighted in green above. Similar to some of the questions that I have reviewed for this exam and other exams we have completed in the past, the tricky part of this question was that I had to keep track of everything that was going on. For this particular question, I had to imagine the circles in their initial position before looking at what shifts put them in the position that they were in as represented in the question. While doing this is not challenging, if I had lost track of where the circle was, I would end up 1. losing valuable time and 2. risk getting the question wrong. It is important that I learn to familiarize myself with these kinds of questions by maybe finding some online or putting emphasis on these kinds of questions to review for the AP exam, as that will definitely put me on the path to doing well. . Final Reflection/Personal Takeaways . Overall, I am very happy with the score that I earned, as it shows that I have a good understanding of what we have studied in this class so far and shows me that I can answer multiple choice questions like these really well. The questions that I reviewed here were also a learning experience for me, as it made me realize how I can approach those kinds of questions in the future to ensure that I reduce the risk of getting them wrong. I like having these opportunities to test myself on what we have learned so far and seeing how well I do, as they almost always are a true learning experience for me. These kinds of tests show me what my strengths and weaknesses are and tell me how I can improve, and I really hope that I reflect great improvement in answering MCQ questions as we continue to do more of them in the future leading up to the AP exam. .",

            "title": "Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # prints out each unique number only once # does not print out the extra 2 or 1 # no duplicate values # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # it involves storing data using some data structure (dictionary, list, etc.) # Hashmaps/hashtables are also another kind of data structure # both cannot have collisions . {1, 2, 3} .

Out of all her masterpieces, &quot;You Belong With Me&quot;, in my opinion, stands out as Taylor Swift&#39;s most iconic and beloved songs. To begin with, &quot;You Belong With Me&quot; is a song that is relatable to many, many groups of people, especially young adults who are in relationships. Its use of powerful lyrics, language, and vocals express the feeling of desiring someone who is currently dating someone else. That feeling of watching someone that you secretly love dating someone else is definitely a situation that many people have found themselves in, and Swift&#39;s masterful storytelling makes listeners feel like they are right there with her, experiencing the same pain and frustration of being in love with someone who is probably out of their league. The chorus of the song, in particular, is incredibly catchy and memorable, with the repeated line &quot;You belong with me&quot; serving as a powerful and emotional hook and forming a more meaningful, powerful connection between Taylor swift and the listening audience. Furthermore, &quot;You Belong With Me&quot; is a song that allows for Swift&#39;s exceptional songwriting abilities to shine and be illuminated for the listeners to hear. The lyrics are witty, clever, and heartfelt, capturing the essence of young love in a way that feels realistic and genuine. I also really love how song is essentially a narrative, as Swift manages to tell a story that many young people can easily understand in just a few minutes. Through her unimaginable songwriting skills and powerful voice, Taylor Swift is able paints a clear picture of a girl who is hopelessly in love with a boy who is dating someone else, conveying a sense of longing and desire that is palpable. Additionally, &quot;You Belong With Me&quot; has had a significant impact on our popular culture and has become a defining song of its era. The music video for the song has especially become a cultural touchstone, with its depiction of a classic nerd as well as a popular girl, in which the man is dating the latter. This kind of storyline is definitely something that many young adult listeners can resonate with, and that is what adds to the meaningful connection between the artist herself and her fans. The song&#39;s message of staying true to oneself and not changing to fit in with societal norms is an important one, and it has inspired countless fans to embrace their individuality and be proud of who they are. In conclusion, &quot;You Belong With Me&quot; is Taylor Swift&#39;s best song ever because of its universal appeal, perfect blend of country and pop influences, exceptional songwriting, and significant impact on popular culture. It is a song that continues to resonate with fans of all ages and has become a timeless classic that will undoubtedly endure for generations to come. . https://justrandomthings.com/2021/04/04/taylor-swift-you-belong-with-me-lyrics-meaning-song-review/ .

            "title": "Individual CPT Outline/Plan",
            "content": "Overview of Our Project . The name of our project is called “Theee Arcade”, and it is intended to serve as an arcade for users to provide them with an immersive, fun experience. The users will have multiple games to choose from and will even be able to view a leader board to see where they are compared to other registered users. On Thursday, we were to present our project idea to the class, but due to the time constraint of 3-5 minutes, we were not quite able to say everything that we wanted to present. This blog serves to talk about our project but in more detail, with heavy emphasis on my individual part of the project. . Team Member Roles . We have assigned each member of our team a page of the project for them to complete so that everybody’s CPT submission will be different but still be based on the same idea. Below is a table that shows the team members, their roles, and their part of the project that they are to complete: . Team Member Scrum Team Role Assigned Part of the Project Purpose . Christopher Albertson | Frontend Developer | Guess the Number! | To help everyone learn their numbers in a fun way. | . Prasith Chilla | Backend Developer | Sports Jeopardy | To entertain the user by having them answer questions regarding sports for points. | . Vyaan Gautam | DevOps | Tic-Tac-Toe | To provide the user with an immersive, fun experience by allowing them to play against a fellow registered player or even a computer player. | . Emaad Mir me) | Frontend Developer | Hangman | To entertain the user and allow them to expand their vocabulary in a fun way. | . Chinmay Ramamurthy | Scrum Master | Guess the Countries | To challenge the user by testing their knowledge of countries around the world and seeing how fast they can name countries that start with a certain letter. | . My Part . Now that you have had the chance to look at what my other teammates are doing, the rest of the blog will focus solely on what I am doing and what my plan is for my part of the project. . Wire Frames/Rough Draft . Below is a model of what I want the Hangman page to look when the user views it (please excuse the terrible Google Drawing, this is just to give me an idea of how it should appear): . . In this VERY rough model, you can see that at the very top, there is a link to every single game that the user can play (mine in bold to indicate that this is for the hangman page). This is essentially how we want to present the other games to the users if they decide they want to play something else. For my page specifically, I plan to have the blanks displayed as well as a letter bank so that the user knows which letters they have already guessed. The hangman will also be shown, with more body parts (head, arms, legs, etc.) appearing as the number of incorrect guesses increases. While this is not specifically in the rough model above, I also am thinking of implementing a time elapsed clock (no time limit, though), as the time taken to guess a certain word would fit well with the leader board that we want to include. . Sample Code . Below is an image of a code segment in Python that basically shows how I want the hangman game to function (only limited to terminal for now). While this may not be a submission that could earn full credit for the Create Performance Task, it definitely meets some of the main College Board criteria. Comments are added to explain not only what the line does but to also show how it could meet the criteria: . . Sample Code: Explanation . While the functionality of the code is pretty self-explanatory, there are some thing worth noting about the above code segment. The blanks list is what allows you to see the number of blanks in the output box that corresponds to the number of letters in the randomly chosen word from word_list. I also added the user_input.lower so that it does not matter if the user inputs an upper case or lower case letter. Once the user has guessed all of the letters in the word correctly, the code will exit and the user will be presented with a “You Win!” message (might be a separate screen for the real deal). . Application of CRUD . A few weeks ago, Mr. Mortensen had a tech talk about CRUD and its importance in view and frontend coding. To recap, here is what each of the letters in CRUD mean: . C - Create | R - Read | U - Update | D - Delete | . Here is how my specific project follows each of these: . Create: Each round, a new word for the user to guess will be randomly chosen from a list, and the blanks and progress made by the user will be initialized as well. | Read: A new letter will be added to the blank if the user guesses a letter correctly, and if the user guesses incorrectly, the number of lives remaining will decrease/the number of incorrect guesses will increase. | Update: If the user guesses a letter correctly, the letters displayed on the blanks will be updated. If the user guesses wrong, however, there will be one more body part of the man that will be hanged. | Delete: For every letter that the user guesses, that letter will be crossed out or removed from the provided letter bank. Once the user has won and guessed the word or has lost all of their lives and lost the game, a new game will be made with another random word generated. | . Application of College Board Criteria . Here is how the sample code above meets the criteria and how it will meet the criteria that it has not quite yet met: . Row on the rubric Application to my project . Program Purpose and Function | The purpose of my project is to entertain and challenge the user by having them guess a word with no hints provided. | . Data Abstraction | My project uses several lists (blanks and progress) to store the number of letters that the user has guessed correctly to be in the word (two code segments to be determined) | . Managing Complexity | The project uses lists to store the user’s entries, which is far more efficient and less time consuming than making a variable for every single entry that the user inputs correctly. | . Procedural Abstraction | The procedure update_progress uses sequencing, selecting, and iteration to keep track of the user’s progress in guessing the word. Once the progress made is equal to the word randomly generated, the user has officially won. | . Algorithm Implementation | My project will call the procedure as described above, although I will continue to figure out more ways to make the algorithm have more depth and complexity to it (not inefficient). | . Testing | A new word will be randomly generated each round with differing results for each of the two test runs (still figuring this row out as well) | . While I am still in the process of figuring out how I can apply my project to the rubric, I believe that what I have right now is a good start and that I will continue to build off of what I have so far leading up to N@tM and when the CPT is actually due. . Plans for the Video . When we were grading the sample CPT submissions for the past few weeks, we saw many videos of the submissions’ code working, with the written response describing what was shown in the video and beyond. . For my project, there are several things that I will need to show in my video submission. Below is again the rough model of my page created earlier, as that will likely be the first thing that the graders see when they look into my submission: . . Some of the things that will likely be necessary for my video include… . A screen that gives the user an option to press the “play” button (or something similar) | Once the user (me) has pressed play, a screen similar to the rough model above will be shown. | Showing me choosing a letter from the word bank and seeing if the letter turned out to be a part of the word or not | Showing the number of chances/lives that I have remaining | Showing specific messages for the user depending on if they have won or lost a game | My video will likely run this program twice, each with different results: One in which I win the game | One in which I lose the game | By winning one game and losing another, the graders will be able to at least see what each screen would look like for every possible result | The graders can also see what it looks like when a new round has started/new random word is generated | . | Showing the parts hanged being added to the hanger if I guess a letter incorrectly | The “You Win!” message or “You Lost! The word was (word)” message | Overall, the video should show the user input, output, and functionality associated with the program that will be described in the written response | . As mentioned before, I am still trying to figure everything out, but some of these bullets will definitely be taken into consideration when I get to making the actual video submission for the Create Performance Task. . Things I am Happy With/Concerned About for My Part of the Project (So Far) . While we are not expected to have the final project ready at this time, there are several things that I am happy with and am looking forward to when I create my project. However, there are also some aspects that I am concerned about implementing/incorporating into my CPT submission. . What I am Happy With . My code sample does actually meet some of the College Board Criteria, and this will definitely be helpful as the deadline for our CPT begins approaching | I can describe in enough detail how my code works, which will be important when I write my written response | My wire frame for the project actually gives me a great idea of how I want everything to be presented to the user and will be a good reference to keep with me as I make more progress on it | . What I am Concerned About . Although what I have thus far is a good start, I am worried that the end product will not have enough depth or complexity to it (not necessarily inefficiency), which can be problematic if I want to get full points on the CPT | My sample code mainly lacks algorithm implementation, and I am concerned that I will not be able to properly incorporate that into the final submission and that I will not be able to describe it in enough detail so that someone else could recreate it | With games such as Hangman, there is no complex mathematical algorithm that goes into fulfilling the overall functionality of the program, as most of it just involves words or letters. I am therefore worried that by not having some mathematical component involved in the algorithm, my algorithm will not include the necessary sequencing, selection, and iteration, thus preventing me from getting the point for that row. | . Reflection . Overall, even though there are several setbacks and limitations to the plan that I have, what I have so far is a great start and is definitely something that I can work with so that it can be improved or more refined. I will make sure to clear up the concerns that I have by maybe researching algorithms that go into making these kinds of games and using it as a source of inspiration (and citing it, of course). By doing this, I will feel much more confident about incorporating the algorithm into my program and modifying it so that it has more depth to it. While my part of the project is very important, my teammates also have their own projects to work on, and I will make sure that I help them if needed, as we will all need to present our parts for N@tM. In essence, I think I have a great idea for how I want my program to turn out in the end and can explain how it meets the College Board criteria to someone who may not be familiar with how the project was made, the rubric, or even both. .",

            "title": "Week of 03-13 Review",
            "content": "Overview: What Am I Talking About? . This week, we were all assigned to do some hacks for 2.4a and 2.4b, which outlined a lot on reviewing sqlite. . Videos . 2.4a . Talked about the OOP-style of programming | Reviewed CRUD Concepts | Discussed each code block of the code | Determined if there was data abstraction and procedural abstraction (yes!) | . 2.4b . Talked about the imperative style of programming | Talked about cursor and conn objects + their attributes | Reviewed CRUD Concepts | Discussed each code block of the code | Determined if there was data abstraction and procedural abstraction (yes!) | . So, How Was the Experience? Difficult? Really Easy? . For the most part, I didn’t have very much travel completing the hacks, although I did run into some challenges from the past. . Challenges . Challenge 1: Having to Get the New Version of Flask . During the tech talk that Mr. Yeung gave about Postman, he demonstrated copying and pasting the link into whichever request it was, whether it was GET or POST (this is also shown in my API/Control video). Many people, including me, began to notice how Yeung’s port number (8086) was different from ours (5000). It turned out that the version of flask from the last trimester was old, and we would need to clone the repository with the new version of flask. Thankfully, this was not too difficult of a task, but I found it interesting about how there was now a completely new version of flask with a new port number. . Challenge 2: Link to Application Would Show Error . Right after cloning the repository, I made sure that my python interpreter was set to base (anaconda) and that I had flask installed using the command pip install flask. However, upon clicking on the link given in the terminal, I came across this error: . . When I asked Mr. Yeung about it, he told me that I needed to follow the instructions in the readme file in the new version of the flask application. Thankfully, when I followed the instructions, the application showed up like it should have, shown below: . . I began to notice, however, that each time I open VSCode (before it was previously not on), I end up having to follow the exact same steps over and over again. Fortunately, the more times I did it, the less work it was to me, and it ended up becoming much less of a burden over time :). . Challenge 3: Many Rows Would Be Added to the Table Unintentionally . When I began to work on adding data to the table and list on the web application, I noticed something very strange. First off, the class I created was a Games class, with three attributes: name, description, and date made. Previously, I had two entries in the table, with both being Hangman. Sometimes, however, if I tried to add something else that was not hangman (POST) and made a GET request proceeding the POST request, not only did it add the new entry, but it also added multiple Hangman entries at the same time, making most of the table filled with the exact same information about Hangman (10 times). Thankfully, once I realized how to make a delete request (which also took some time!), I was able to remove all extra entries and make it so that only the entry I made a POST request for would show up after the GET request. . Challenge 4: Debugging Mode . One of the things we had to do for the database video was that we had to show a debugging session. However, whenever I tried clicking the “Run &amp; Debug” button in the main.py file, I would always get that there was a syntax error of some sort within the main.py file. I tried looking up the error on several forums such as stack overflow and GitHub issues. I ended up adding rows to the table in an alternative way, which was adding entries using the games.py file, which worked as expected. Next time, I will make sure to ask questions about the debugging mode so that I can do everything as asked and assigned by the teacher. . Reflection . As shown by the three challenges above, I did not have an easy time completing this. However, I think that these challenges really helped me learn a lot, and I hope that the two videos I made will serve as a helpful study/recap tool for both myself and other students taking this class. Even though the process was quite rough, I still enjoyed the feeling I got when I was able to get everything working the way it was supposed to. Also, if I ever play Hangman, I will always be reminded of doing this project! . .",

            "title": "Big Idea 2 Quiz",
            "content": "Overview . This week, we had to take a 25-question quiz about Big Idea 2 that was based on everything that we have learned so far in the past two weeks. This blog goes over any questions that I got wrong or questions that took me some time to answer before I arrived at the right answer. I hope this will be a helpful tool for myself and for anyone who happens to visit this blog! . My Score . I earned a score of 25/25, as shown below: . . My score indicates that I show a very good understanding of everything we have learned in this unit and that I am strong in answering the kinds of questions that were on here. However, there are a few questions that I would like to review, as there were some that required me to think about it for a long time before I arrived at my answer. . Questions to Review . Question 18 . The first question to review is question 18, shown below: . . The correct answer to this question was D, which is described above in the choice highlighted in green. While I did get this question right, I took some time to answer it, as this question required me to read multiple data tables that have descriptions of each file name and what they contain. Based on what I read, I would have to come up with a conclusion on how I could send emails to the appropriate people as described in the question. After carefully reading everything while considering the scenario, I was able to come up with the correct answer (D). One way I can improve my confidence in these kinds of questions is to perhaps jot down a few notes about what I see in each table, as I will likely be able to absorb the information better and thus not take too much time to answer the question. . Question 21 . The second question to review is question 21, shown below: . . There were two correct answers to this question, which were B and D, as described above in the choices highlighted in green. While I did get this question right, I took some time to answer it, as this question required me to read multiple spreadsheets that had the photographer, subject, year, and if they were publicly available. Based on what I read, I would have to come up with a conclusion on how I could identify the desired entry described in the question. After carefully reading everything and considering what the question was asking, I was able to come up with the two correct answers, B and D. College Board gives an explanation for this question, which is that “Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet.”One way I can improve my confidence in these kinds of questions is to maybe write down a few notes that keeps track of everything important that I see in each table, as I will likely be able to absorb the information better and thus not take too much time to answer the question. . Question 24 . The third and last question to review is question 24, shown below: . . The correct answer to this question was A, which was that the next student will be assigned the binary number of 1001 0100 (148 in decimal). While I did get this question right, I took some time to answer it, as I had to think about what each binary value was in decimal so that I could tell which option was 1 higher than the binary number in the question. This put me at risk for getting the question wrong, as if I lost track of even one 0 or 1, I could have ended up getting the question wrong. After carefully thinking about both binary numbers in decimal, I was able to come up with the correct answer (A). One way I can improve my confidence in these kinds of questions is to maybe write down the binary number described in the question and to also write down all of the other choices that are in binary. This way, I can quickly work out what each binary number is in decimal and decide which answer is the correct answer. I will also reduce the likelihood of me getting the question wrong, as I will be able to see everything that is going on and make any adjustments if necessary. . Big Idea 2 Quiz Reflection/Personal Takeaways . Overall, I am very happy with the score that I earned, as it shows that I have a good understanding of what we have studied in this class so far and shows me that I can answer multiple choice questions like these really well. The questions that I reviewed here were also a learning experience for me, as it made me realize how I can approach those kinds of questions in the future to ensure that I reduce the risk of getting them wrong. I like having these opportunities to test myself on what we have learned so far and seeing how well I do, as they almost always are a true learning experience for me. These kinds of tests show me what my strengths and weaknesses are and tell me how I can improve, and I really hope that I reflect great improvement in answering MCQ questions as we continue to do more of them in the future leading up to the AP exam. .",

Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . Schema is essentially the category/column of a table. . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? | . The purpose of an identity Column in a SQL database is to help us know what the rest of the column is about, what kinds of data types it will contain, and any other relevant information. . What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? | . A primary key is something that is used to identify someone. The primary key (i.e. id) should be unique to each user so that it is easy to tell who is who. . What are the Data Types in SQL table? | . Integers, structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.), strings, floats, and many more. . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() # varchar = string # 255 = max length .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? | . A connection object is an object that is created using the sqlite3.connect() method to connect to a SQLite database. It represents a connection to a database file and provides methods to execute SQL commands and interact with the database. After looking it up, I think that the connection object acts like a network connection by functioning as a connection to the database. . Same for cursor object? | . The cursor object is used to execute SQL commands and fetch data from the database. It acts as a pointer to a specific row or a set of rows in the database. . The cursor object allows the application to execute SQL commands and retrieve data from the database by providing methods such as execute() and fetchall(). The execute() method is used to execute an SQL command and the fetchall() method is used to fetch all the data retrieved from the database. . Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? | . For the conn object, I see that some of its attributes include in_transaction, isolation_level, and row_factory. For the cursor object, I see that some of its attributes include arraysize, lastrowid, row_factory, and rowcount. . Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? | . Yes, &quot;results&quot; is an object because it not only appears under the the list of local variables, but it also includes data used as a part of the functionality of the program. It includes the attributes of each user, such as their name, their uid, and their date of birth. . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | . The create() function in the OOP was called on an object. The imperative version involves creating numerous variables within the function rather than the objects. Both of these have their own pros and cons. The imperative version is less error prone, but also less efficient. The converse is true for the create() in the OOP version. Imperative version does not censor your password. Using OOP might be easier if one is trying to work with large amounts of data. If one is trying to work with a small amount of data, imperative might work better. . Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | . The purpose of the SQL INSERT statement in this code is to insert a new row of data into the &quot;users&quot; table of a SQLite database. The INSERT INTO statement specifies the name of the table and the columns where the data should be inserted, and the VALUES clause provides the values to be inserted into those columns. The ? placeholders are used to prevent SQL injection attacks by sanitizing user input. . The INSERT INTO statement in this code is similar to the init method of a User class in that both are used to create a new record or object in the database. However, there are some differences. The INSERT INTO statement only inserts data into a table in the database, while the init method of a User class creates a new instance of a class in memory. . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | . The &quot;hacked&quot; part in the code is meant to provide a password that meets the minimum length requirement (2 characters) for security purposes. The message variable is set to &quot;hacked&quot; in this case to indicate that the password was automatically set. . Explain try/except, when would except occur? | . The try/except block is used to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the SQL command. In this case, the try block contains the SQL command to update the password for the specified user, and the except block catches any sqlite3. Error exceptions that might be raised during the execution of the command. If an exception occurs, the code inside the except block is executed. . What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . The code that connects to the database and creates a cursor object is repeated in each of these examples. This is because it is necessary to establish a connection to the database in order to execute SQL commands. The cursor object is used to execute the SQL commands and interact with the database. Once the SQL commands have been executed, the cursor and connection objects need to be closed to free up resources and prevent memory leaks. . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #update() . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | . DELETE can be a dangerous operation if used carelessly as it permanently removes data from the database, and if it is used with caution, it can result in unintended data loss or corruption. . In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | . The &quot;f&quot; before the string is used for f-strings, which are a way of formatting strings that allows you to include the values of variables directly in the string. The curly braces {} surrounding uid indicate that the value of the uid variable should be inserted at that position in the string. This provides a much easier alternative than .format() . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | . The menu repeats so that if the user would like to perform multiple operations in one sitting (create and red for example), they can do so. They can perform as many operations as they would like until they don&#39;t input anything or make the program exit. . Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . Yes, I could refactor this menu with a list, such as perhaps using list comprehension in Python. . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . A new user record idc has been created (0, &#39;id&#39;, &#39;INTEGER&#39;, 1, None, 1) (1, &#39;name&#39;, &#39;VARCHAR(255)&#39;, 1, None, 0) (2, &#39;price&#39;, &#39;FLOAT&#39;, 1, None, 0) (3, &#39;release_date&#39;, &#39;DATE&#39;, 1, None, 0) (4, &#39;developer&#39;, &#39;VARCHAR(255)&#39;, 1, None, 0) (5, &#39;publisher&#39;, &#39;VARCHAR(255)&#39;, 1, None, 0) . Hacks . Add this Blog to you own Blogging site. In the Blog add notes and observations on each code cell. | In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction? | In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture Do you see data abstraction? Complement this with Debugging example. | Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project. | . | . Reference... sqlite documentation . Procedural Abstraction Question . Recalling the College Board criteria, procedural abstraction refers to the concept of breaking down a program into a set of code blocks or functions that perform specific tasks. These procedures or functions can be called from various parts of the program as needed, without the calling code having to know the internal details of how the function works. I can see procedural abstraction being used in this implementation, as there are separate functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records in the database. The menu function acts as a controller that allows the user to choose which operation they want to perform. For example, in the create() function, it prompts the user to enter the required details, connects to the database, creates a cursor object, executes an SQL command to insert the data into the database, and then closes the cursor and connection objects. This entire process occurs by calling the create() function. Overall, since there are multiple functions with specific tasks included in this implementation, there is definitely procedural abstraction being used here. . Data Abstraction Question . Recalling the College Board criteria, data abstraction is essentially representing something (i.e a program) in a much more simplified, condensed method while hiding its more internal functions. Looking at this implementation, I do see data abstraction in this implementation. The implementation hides the details of the underlying database operations from the user, providing a simple interface for performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their data. The user interacts with the program through a menu system, which hides the implementation details from the user and provides an abstraction of the available operations. . For example, when the user selects the &quot;create&quot; operation from the menu, they are prompted for the necessary information (name, uid, password, dob), and the implementation takes care of inserting this information into the database. . Regarding debugging, one possible example is if the user enters invalid input (e.g., a non-existent uid when updating or deleting a user). In this case, the implementation catches the exception raised by the database operation and prints an error message to the user. The error message provides a high-level explanation of the problem (&quot;No uid was found in the table&quot;), without revealing the underlying implementation details. This is an example of data abstraction, as the implementation is hiding the details of the database operation (in this case, the SQL query) from the user and providing a simplified, high-level interface for working with the data. . Debugging Screenshots . from PIL import Image debug = Image.open(&#39;../images/attributes.png&#39;) debug1 = Image.open(&#39;../images/conncursor.png&#39;) display(debug) display(debug1) . Debugging Screenshots Analysis . In the first screenshot, I showed an example of what the code does if I choose the create operation (&#39;C&#39;). As you can see, when I am in debug mode, on the bottom left, you can see what I typed in for each of the different attributes, such as the date of birth, my password, and some of the other attributes. As I was doing that, the debugger highlighted what part of the code block was being executed in that moment, which allowed me to have a greater understand of what code does as it is being ran. In addition, as I step into more and more, you can see that the objects conn and cursor appear on the top left as well. The attributes for each of those objects can also be seen as well. Overall, playing around with the debugging provided me with a much better and more thorough understanding of how we are able to run and execute code so that it fulfills its purpose of providing us with the desired output. .

Structured Query Language, abbreviated as SQL, is a language used in programming, managing, and structuring data | . | . Imports and Flask Objects . Defines and key object creations . Comment on where you have observed these working? Provide a defintion of purpose. . Flask app object . We have used flask app objects as APIs from trimesters 1 and 2. It allows us to register new blueprints, which was important for us in order to create our API connecting the frontend and backend together. . | SQLAlchemy db object . We have used the db object in order to create our database from last trimester. When we set db equal to the SQLAlchemy object, we were registering our database, which allowed for the creation of our sqlite data table as well as the database containing everything that is needed. . | | . &quot;&quot;&quot; These imports define the key objects &quot;&quot;&quot; from flask import Flask from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy &quot;&quot;&quot; These object and definitions are used throughout the Jupyter Notebook. &quot;&quot;&quot; # Setup of key Flask object (app) app = Flask(__name__) # Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db) database = &#39;sqlite:///sqlite.db&#39; # path and filename of database app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = database app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;SECRET_KEY&#39; db = SQLAlchemy() # This belongs in place where it runs once per project db.init_app(app) . Model Definition . Define columns, initialization, and CRUD methods for users table in sqlite.db . Comment on these items in the class, purpose and defintion. . class User . The class User can be thought of as creating a new person with its different characteristics. It works the same way here, as the class User is going to include multiple attributes, such as their user id, their date of birth, age, and more. . | db.Model inheritance . The User class inherits from db.Model, which allows the class to inherit a variety of useful properties and methods, such as the ability to define database columns using db.Column and the ability to perform database operations such as adding, updating, and deleting records using methods like create(), update(), and delete(). . | init method . The init() method is what constructs the User object, which initializes the instance variables within the object. . | @property, @&lt;column&gt;.setter . The @property and @setter methods are getter and setter functions, respectively, that allow the attributes to be accessed and updated. . | create, read, update, delete methods . The create(), read(), update(), and delete() methods all implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the &#39;users&#39; table. The create() method adds a new user object to the table, the read() method outputs a dictionary representation of the user object, the update() method updates the attributes of the user object (includes before and after), and the delete() method removes the user object from the table. . | . | . &quot;&quot;&quot; database dependencies to support sqlite examples &quot;&quot;&quot; import datetime from datetime import datetime import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash &#39;&#39;&#39; Tutorial: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/library.html#tutorials, try to get into a Python shell and follow along &#39;&#39;&#39; # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table # -- Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is the key concept of SQLAlchemy # -- a.) db.Model is like an inner layer of the onion in ORM # -- b.)

Initial Data . Uses SQLALchemy db.create_all() to initialize rows into sqlite.db . Comment on how these work? . Create All Tables from db Object . The &quot;db.create_all&quot; line creates all the tables defined in the database schema with the SQLAlchemy ORM. It reads the schema and creates the tables in the connected database. . | User Object Constructors . The code creates instances of the User class using the constructor with different combinations of arguments, such as name, uid, password, and date of birth. It initializes these instances as u1, u2, and so on. . | Try / Except . The try/except lines create a new row in the User table with the data passed to the constructor. If the data is valid and the row is successfully created, create() will output the created User object. Otherwise, it raises an exception. The try/except block handles any exceptions that may occur during the creation process, such as duplicate user ids or other validation errors. If an exception is caught, the function prints an error message indicating the cause. . | | . &quot;&quot;&quot;Database Creation and Testing &quot;&quot;&quot; # Builds working data for testing def initUsers(): with app.app_context(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Create database and tables&quot;&quot;&quot; db.create_all() &quot;&quot;&quot;Tester data for table&quot;&quot;&quot; u1 = User(name=&#39;Thomas Edison&#39;, uid=&#39;toby&#39;, password=&#39;123toby&#39;, dob=datetime(1847, 2, 11)) u2 = User(name=&#39;Nikola Tesla&#39;, uid=&#39;niko&#39;, password=&#39;123niko&#39;) u3 = User(name=&#39;Alexander Graham Bell&#39;, uid=&#39;lex&#39;, password=&#39;123lex&#39;) u4 = User(name=&#39;Eli Whitney&#39;, uid=&#39;whit&#39;, password=&#39;123whit&#39;) u5 = User(name=&#39;Indiana Jones&#39;, uid=&#39;indi&#39;, dob=datetime(1920, 10, 21)) u6 = User(name=&#39;Marion Ravenwood&#39;, uid=&#39;raven&#39;, dob=datetime(1921, 10, 21)) # locals include age, name, date of birth, user id, etc. # debugging allows you to go in to see if there is any problems with your code (ex. missing an attribute like user id) # once you have your users, your sqlite.db file is created users = [u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6] &quot;&quot;&quot;Builds sample user/note(s) data&quot;&quot;&quot; for user in users: try: &#39;&#39;&#39;add user to table&#39;&#39;&#39; object = user.create() print(f&quot;Created new uid {object.uid}&quot;) except: # error raised if object nit created &#39;&#39;&#39;fails with bad or duplicate data&#39;&#39;&#39; print(f&quot;Records exist uid {user.uid}, or error.&quot;) initUsers() .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQLALchemy and custom user.create() method to add row. . Comment on purpose of following . user.find_by_uid() and try/except . The user.find_by_uid(uid) method is used to check if a user with the given uid already exists in the database. The try/except block is used to handle the case when no user is found with the given uid. If user.read() is called when user is None, it will raise an AttributeError, so the try/except block is used to catch this error and continue with creating a new user. . | user = User(...) . user = User(...) creates a new instance of the User class with the given attributes. It initializes a new User object with the name, uid, and password provided by the user through the input() method. . | user.dob and try/except . user.dob sets the date of birth attribute for the User object. The try/except block is used to handle the case when the inputted date is invalid, for example, when the inputted date does not follow the format &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;. If the date is invalid, the current date is used instead and the user is informed that the date was invalid. . | user.create() and try/except . user.create() method is a custom method that is used to add a new row to the database table for the given User object.

The json_ready variable is assigned a list of JSON objects that represent the records in the User table. The list is generated using a list comprehension, which is an efficient way of generating lists in Python. The list comprehension [user.read() for user in table] loops through each User object in the table list and calls the read() method on each object, which returns a JSON representation of the user.

            "content": "Overview of This Blog . This week, we had two lessons: one for 2.2 and one for 2.3. This blog includes the hacks that we were assigned to do for 2.3, which was all about extracting information from data. I plan to use this as one of my study tools as we begin to prepare for the AP Exam on May 8. . Early Seed Award . The secret seed award for 2.3 was simply having the data files added to our repository before the tech talk was given. Below are the files that we had to add, along with some of their contents: . from PIL import Image proof1 = Image.open(&#39;../images/datafile.png&#39;) proof2 = Image.open(&#39;../images/gradefile.png&#39;) print(&quot;DATA.CSV FILE&quot;) display(proof1) print(&quot;GRADE.JSON FILE&quot;) display(proof2) . DATA.CSV FILE . GRADE.JSON FILE . AP Prep . 2.3 College Board Practice Problems . (1) A researcher is analyzing data about students in a school district to determine whether there is a relationship between grade point average and number of absences. The researcher plans on compiling data from several sources to create a record for each student. . The researcher has access to a database with the following information about each student. . Last name . First name . Grade level (9, 10, 11, or 12) . Grade point average (on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale) . The researcher also has access to another database with the following information about each student. . First name . Last name . Number of absences from school . Number of late arrivals to school . Upon compiling the data, the researcher identifies a problem due to the fact that neither data source uses a unique ID number for each student. Which of the following best describes the problem caused by the lack of unique ID numbers? . (A) Students who have the same name may be confused with each other. . (B) Students who have the same grade point average may be confused with each other. . (C) Students who have the same grade level may be confused with each other. . (D) Students who have the same number of absences may be confused with each other. . Correct Answer: A . (2) A team of researchers wants to create a program to analyze the amount of pollution reported in roughly 3,000 counties across the United States. The program is intended to combine county data sets and then process the data. Which of the following is most likely to be a challenge in creating the program? . (A) A computer program cannot combine data from different files. . (B) Different counties may organize data in different ways. . (C) The number of counties is too large for the program to process. .

On average, how long does homework take you each night (in minutes)? . On average, how long do you study for each test (in minutes)? . Do you enjoy the subject material of this class (yes or no)? . Which of the following questions about the students who responded to the survey can the teacher answer by analyzing the survey results? . I. Do students who enjoy the subject material tend to spend more time on homework each night than the other students do? . II. Do students who spend more time on homework each night tend to spend less time studying for tests than the other students do? . III. Do students who spend more time studying for tests tend to earn higher grades in the class than the other students do? . (A) I only . (B) III only . (C) I and II . (D) I and III . Correct Answer: C . from PIL import Image print(&quot;SCORE: &quot;) score = Image.open(&#39;../images/extractinginfoscore.png&#39;) display(score) . SCORE: . As shown in the above image, I earned a 6/6 (100%) on Extracting Data from Information quiz, which indicates that I have a very good understanding of what we learned this week. Generally speaking, as I was completing this quiz, I really had no trouble answering any of the questions and none of them really forced me to think for a while before arriving at the correct answer. While it is great I earned a good score on this mini quiz, it is also important that I refer back to this quiz along with many of the other tests and quizzes that we have taken on College Board, as all of these will definitely serve as useful study tools for the AP exam. It is also important that I continue to practice more on questions like the one on this quiz, as one quiz may not always be enough to indicate that I am strong in answering these kinds of questions. Overall, I am very happy with my score and believe that this quiz will be useful in helping me study for the AP exam coming up. . 2.3 Notes .

In this lecture, several code blocks were used to demonstrate how to use Pandas to extract information from a data set. The next part of this blog lists some of the observations of each code block as well as what each one does. In the first code cell, the following code was used to import the Pandas library: . In the first code cell, the following code was used to import the Pandas library, shown below: . &#39;&#39;&#39;Pandas is used to gather data sets through its DataFrames implementation&#39;&#39;&#39; import pandas as pd . This code cell had to be ran first before running any of the other cells proceeding it, as not doing so would result in errors stating that &quot;pd&quot; was not defined. The second code cell is shown below: . df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/grade.json&#39;) print(df) # What part of the data set needs to be cleaned? # From PBL learning, what is a good time to clean data? Hint, remember Garbage in, Garbage out? . Student ID Year in School GPA 0 123 12 3.57 1 246 10 4.00 2 578 12 2.78 3 469 11 3.45 4 324 Junior 4.75 5 313 20 3.33 6 145 12 2.95 7 167 10 3.90 8 235 9th Grade 3.15 9 nil 9 2.80 10 469 11 3.45 11 456 10 2.75 . This code cell demonstrated how to check what data needs to be cleaned using the pd.read_json() function to read a JSON file into a DataFrame, and then the print() function was used to display the DataFrame. The output of the print() function showed that the data set has incomplete data that needs to be cleaned, as shown by the &quot;nil&quot; and the 20th grade. The third code cell is shown below: . print(df[[&#39;GPA&#39;]]) print() #try two columns and remove the index from print statement print(df[[&#39;Student ID&#39;,&#39;GPA&#39;]].to_string(index=False)) . GPA 0 3.57 1 4.00 2 2.78 3 3.45 4 4.75 5 3.33 6 2.95 7 3.90 8 3.15 9 2.80 10 3.45 11 2.75 Student ID GPA 123 3.57 246 4.00 578 2.78 469 3.45 324 4.75 313 3.33 145 2.95 167 3.90 235 3.15 nil 2.80 469 3.45 456 2.75 . This code cell demonstrated how to extract columns from a data set using the df[[&#39;column_name&#39;]] function. The print(df[[&#39;GPA&#39;]]) function extracted the &#39;GPA&#39; column, and the print(df[[&#39;Student ID&#39;,&#39;GPA&#39;]].to_string(index=False)) function extracted the &#39;Student ID&#39; and &#39;GPA&#39; columns and removed the index from the printed statement. The fourth code segment is shown below: . print(df.sort_values(by=[&#39;GPA&#39;])) print() #sort the values in reverse order print(df.sort_values(by=[&#39;GPA&#39;], ascending=False)) . Student ID Year in School GPA 11 456 10 2.75 2 578 12 2.78 9 nil 9 2.80 6 145 12 2.95 8 235 9th Grade 3.15 5 313 20 3.33 3 469 11 3.45 10 469 11 3.45 0 123 12 3.57 7 167 10 3.90 1 246 10 4.00 4 324 Junior 4.75 Student ID Year in School GPA 4 324 Junior 4.75 1 246 10 4.00 7 167 10 3.90 0 123 12 3.57 3 469 11 3.45 10 469 11 3.45 5 313 20 3.33 8 235 9th Grade 3.15 6 145 12 2.95 9 nil 9 2.80 2 578 12 2.78 11 456 10 2.75 . This code cell demonstrated how to sort values in a data set using the df.sort_values(by=[&#39;column_name&#39;]) function. The print(df.sort_values(by=[&#39;GPA&#39;])) function sorted the data set by &#39;GPA&#39; in ascending order, while the print(df.sort_values(by=[&#39;GPA&#39;], ascending=False)) function sorted the data set by &#39;GPA&#39; in descending order. The fifth code segment is shown below: . print(df[df.GPA &gt; 3.00]) . Student ID Year in School GPA 0 123 12 3.57 1 246 10 4.00 3 469 11 3.45 4 324 Junior 4.75 5 313 20 3.33 7 167 10 3.90 8 235 9th Grade 3.15 10 469 11 3.45 . This code cell demonstrated how to filter data in a data set using the df[df.column_name &gt; value] function. The print(df[df.GPA &gt; 3.00]) function filtered the data set to only show rows with a &#39;GPA&#39; value greater than 3.00. The sixth and final code segment is shown below: . print(df[df.GPA == df.GPA.max()]) print() print(df[df.GPA == df.GPA.min()]) . Student ID Year in School GPA 4 324 Junior 4.75 Student ID Year in School GPA 11 456 10 2.75 . This code cell by itself is pretty self-explanatory in terms of what it does. The dataframe specifically extracts information from the GPA column and returns the highest (max) GPA. In addition, the dataframe also returns the lowest (min) GPA. . 2.3 Reflection . Overall, Pandas is a powerful tool for analyzing data in Python, as it provides several features for extracting information from a data set, including extracting columns, sorting values, and filtering data. While Pandas has the ability to do many different things with data, before analyzing a data set, it is important to check what data needs to be cleaned so that the data is accurate and thus displayed as desired. .

            "title": "2.2 Data Compression, Images",
            "content": "Overview of this blog . This week, we had two lessons: one for 2.2 and one for 2.3. This blog includes the hacks that we were assigned to do for 2.2, which was all about data compression (lossy/lossless) and images (grey scaling, resizing, etc.). I plan to use this as one of my study tools as we begin to prepare for the AP Exam on May 8. . Early Seed Award . For the secret seed award, we had to generate an image of a smiley face using PIL, as you cannot just simply insert an image url into a python notebook. We were then asked to show the smiley face appearing on our blog (ran locally). Below is an image of exactly that (generated from PIL!) . from PIL import Image proof = Image.open(&#39;../images/proofthatitworks.png&#39;) display(proof) . AP Prep . Lossy Image and Lossless Image . Below are two images. One of them is more likely to result in lossy compression while one of them is more likely to result in lossless compression. Without scrolling down, try to guess which one is which! . from PIL import Image smile = Image.open(&#39;../images/smileyface.png&#39;) display(smile) . from PIL import Image green = Image.open(&#39;../images/green-square-16.png&#39;) new_green = green.resize((700,700)) new_green.save(&#39;../images/green-square-320.png&#39;) display(new_green) . The image with the CREEPY smiley face would likely result in lossy compression. As you can see, the image does not just consist of yellow; it also has black and some parts that are even white. Therefore, reducing the image size to free up space would make a more noticeable reduction in the overall quality of the image. . The image with the green square, on the other hand, would likely result in lossless compression. As you can clearly see, the image is simply a green background and nothing else. Thus, reducing the size of the image while still maintaining its original quality will not be an issue, as using lossless compression on this image will have a much smaller impact on the overall quality of the image. . 2.2 College Board Practice Problems . The college board practice problems were essentially the quiz questions for 2.2 available on College Board. The questions are shown below, along with an image of my final score: . (1) Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm? . Possible Answers: . (A) A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee that compressed information is kept secure, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. . (B) A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. . (C) A lossless compression algorithm typically allows for faster transmission speeds than does a lossy compression algorithm. . (D) A lossless compression algorithm typically provides a greater reduction in the number of bits stored or transmitted than does a lossy compression algorithm. . Correct answer: B . (2) A user wants to save a data file on an online storage site. The user wants to reduce the size of the file, if possible, and wants to be able to completely restore the file to its original version. Which of the following actions best supports the user’s needs? . Possible Answers: . (A) Compressing the file using a lossless compression algorithm before uploading it . (B) Compressing the file using a lossy compression algorithm before uploading it . (C) Compressing the file using both lossy and lossless compression algorithms before uploading it . (D) Uploading the original file without using any compression algorithm . Correct answer: A . (3) A programmer is developing software for a social media platform. The programmer is planning to use compression when users send attachments to other users. Which of the following is a true statement about the use of compression? . Possible Answers: . (A) Lossless compression of video files will generally save more space than lossy compression of video files. . (B) Lossless compression of an image file will generally result in a file that is equal in size to the original file. . (C) Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does. . (D) Sound clips compressed with lossy compression for storage on the platform can be restored to their original quality when they are played. . Correct answer: C . from PIL import Image print(&quot;SCORE: &quot;) score = Image.open(&#39;../images/datacompressionscore.png&#39;) display(score) . SCORE: . As shown in the above image, I earned a 3/3 (100%) on the Data Compression quiz, which indicates that I have a very good understanding of what we learned this week. Generally speaking, as I was completing this quiz, I really had no trouble answering any of the questions and none of them really forced me to think for a while before arriving at the correct answer. While it is great I earned a good score on this mini quiz, it is also important that I refer back to this quiz along with many of the other tests and quizzes that we have taken on College Board, as all of these will definitely serve as useful study tools for the AP exam. It is also important that I continue to practice more on questions like the one on this quiz, as one quiz may not always be enough to indicate that I am strong in answering these kinds of questions. Overall, I am very happy with my score and believe that this quiz will be useful in helping me study for the AP exam coming up. . 2.2 Notes/Observations/Answers to Any Questions . base64 questions . How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? | . In Base 64, there are 64 possible characters, while in binary and hexadecimal, there are only 8 and 16 characters, respectively. . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. | . My name: Emaad First three letters: Ema . 45 6D 61 . E M A . buffering questions . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | . I have been a consumer of buffering when it comes to transferring pictures from my camera and uploading them on to my Google Photos account. Buffering involves temporarily storiing data as one moves it from one place to another, so in that sense, the images that I want added to my Google Photos serve as the data being stored. . From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | . With buffering, I have been able to retain the original resolution of the desired images while still moving the image data from one place to another. . Effects . How do these effects apply to images? | . In my experience, I have used buffers to change some attributes of the image, such as the size and scale, the format, the file type (png, jpg, heic, etc.) and many more. While I do end up getting the desired product, whether it was changing the size or file type, I have found that it can sometimes reduce the quality of the image slightly and make the image look a little &quot;off&quot; from the original. On the surface, it may not look like anything has changed, but when you look closely, one can begin to clearly notice the differences. . grey scale question . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? | . Yes, this code definitely acts as a series of steps being performed, as there are several functions and procedures tat go into making the image tinted grey. . Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? | . The scale for each image changes depending on what it was initially, For example, originally, the green square image was smaller, but using the scale function, it was made much larger. With the scale for the second image, there was no visible change (may have been made slightly larger), however, for the third image (largest image), the image was shrunk down a lot. . Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? | . (1) Import the necessary libraries, such as PIL, base64, and numpy. . (2) Create a list of images that you would like to make grey (or whatever the desired color is) . (3) Create functions that will resize/rescale the image however you want it (shrink it, enlarge it, keep it the same, etc.) . (4) Convert the images into base64 . (5) Create the function that will play the main role of tinting the images grey . (6) For every pixel in the image, if the length of the pixel list is greater than 3, then the grey data will be appended and will be updated accordingly . (7) Print both the original image and the grey image with the different size, scale, etc. so that the user can see what changed between the two . Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? | . Yes, scale image is a type of compression in that it is a lossless data compression. Lossless data compression involves resizing the images into a smaller version, which aligns with how you can scale the image in order to make it smaller while still retaining its data and resolution. . 2.2 Programming Paradig (Red/Green/Blue Scaling Implementation, research, etc.) . Lossy and Lossless Image Compression Research . While the 2.2 Blog briefly defines lossy and lossless compression, it is important that we acknowledge that both kinds of compression have their advantages and disadvantages. It is also important that we understand some specific examples of lossy or lossless data compression so that if we get a question regarding compression that we know which kind would work better and why. . Lossy Compression: Notes + Advantages + Examples . Lossy compression algorithms reduces the file size by removing some of the original data Removes data that is generally considered to be &quot;less important&quot; | . | Used when storage space needs to be &quot;freed up&quot; | Advantages + Disadvantages of Lossy Compression Advantages Smaller file size takes up less space, which allows more storage to be left over | Faster transmission time | . | Disadvantages Quality of the image/file diminishes due to some of the data being removed | Original file&#39;s data cannot be reconstructed | . | . | When to use lossy data compression Updating your website: using lossy would be best here, as a smaller file size will produce faster load times | Freeing up space: If you have used up almost all of your space and need to free up some, lossy works best if you don&#39;t care about the quality of the images | . | . Lossless Compression: Notes + Advantages + Examples . Lossless data compression reduces file size by removing unnecessary metadata while still restoring the original file&#39;s data Allows the image to take up less space while having little to no impact on the quality of the image | . | No data is lost | Advantages + Disadvantages of Lossless Compression Advantages Smaller file size while still maximizing its original quality | . | Disadvantages While lossless data compression reduces the file size, it only does so slightly, meaning that it takes up more space Due to the original quality of the image being restored | . | . | . | When to use lossless data compression When you want to change the image file type: if you want to convert, say, a jpg image to png, lossless data compression would work best to maximize the quality of the image | Including a large image: if you want to insert an image that is large in size while still maintaining its original quality, lossless data compression would definitely work best | . | .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . Allows you to have text in your images | . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. | . In Base 64, there are 64 possible characters, while in binary and hexadecimal, there are only 8 and 16 characters, respectively. My name: Emaad First three letters: Ema 45 6D 61 E M A . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | . I have been a consumer of buffering when it comes to transferring pictures from my camera and uploading them on to my Google Photos account. Buffering involves temporarily storiing data as one moves it from one place to another, so in that sense, the images that I want added to my Google Photos serve as the data being stored. . From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | . With buffering, I have been able to retain the original resolution of the desired images while still moving the image data from one place to another. . Effects . How do these effects apply to images? | . In my experience, I have used buffers to change some attributes of the image, such as the size and scale, the format, the file type (png, jpg, heic, etc.) and many more. While I do end up getting the desired product, whether it was changing the size or file type, I have found that it can sometimes reduce the quality of the image slightly and make the image look a little &quot;off&quot; from the original. On the surface, it may not look like anything has changed, but when you look closely, one can begin to clearly notice the differences. . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? | . Yes, this code definitely acts as a series of steps being performed, as there are several functions and procedures tat go into making the image tinted grey. . Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? | . The scale for each image changes depending on what it was initially, For example, originally, the green square image was smaller, but using the scale function, it was made much larger. With the scale for the second image, there was no visible change (may have been made slightly larger), however, for the third image (largest image), the image was shrunk down a lot. . Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? | . (1) Import the necessary libraries, such as PIL, base64, and numpy. . (2) Create a list of images that you would like to make grey (or whatever the desired color is) . (3) Create functions that will resize/rescale the image however you want it (shrink it, enlarge it, keep it the same, etc.) . (4) Convert the images into base64 . (5) Create the function that will play the main role of tinting the images grey . (6) For every pixel in the image, if the length of the pixel list is greater than 3, then the grey data will be appended and will be updated accordingly . (7) Print both the original image and the grey image with the different size, scale, etc. so that the user can see what changed between the two . Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? | . Yes, scale image is a type of compression in that it is a lossless data compression. Lossless data compression involves resizing the images into a smaller version, which aligns with how you can scale the image in order to make it smaller while still retaining its data and resolution. . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np class Image_Data: def __init__(self, source, label, file, path, baseWidth=320): self._source = source # variables with self prefix become part of the object, self._label = label self._file = file self._filename = path / file # file with path self._baseWidth = baseWidth # Open image and scale to needs self._img = pilImage.open(self._filename) self._format = self._img.format self._mode = self._img.mode self._originalSize = self.img.size self.scale_image() self._html = self.image_to_html(self._img) self._html_grey = self.image_to_html_grey() @property def source(self): return self._source @property def label(self): return self._label @property def file(self): return self._file @property def filename(self): return self._filename @property def img(self): return self._img @property def format(self): return self._format @property def mode(self): return self._mode @property def originalSize(self): return self._originalSize @property def size(self): return self._img.size @property def html(self): return self._html @property def html_grey(self): return self._html_grey # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(self): scalePercent = (self._baseWidth/float(self._img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(self._img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (self._baseWidth, scaleHeight) self._img = self._img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_html(self, img): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, self._format) return &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39;

            "title": "Tri 2 Final Blog/Review",
            "content": "Overview . This blog shows some of the questions that I either got wrong or forced me to think about the answer for a little while before getting it right. It also goes into detail on questions I got wrong and what I can do better to not make that same mistake on a question like that for the future. . My Score . The final exam was 50 questions for a grand total of 50 points. I earned a score of 50/50 (100%), as shown below: . My score indicates that I have a very solid understanding of all the concepts on the exam; however, there were a few questions that forced me to think for a while before I arrived at the correct answer. . Questions to Review . Question 21 . The first question to review is question 21, shown below: . . The correct answer was C, which was that the test case was not sufficient to conclude the program is correct. While I did choose the right answer, I was initially tempted to choose A, which was that the conclusion was correct and that the program works as intended for all cases. However, I realized that choice A would be wrong, as the program would not work as intended if the first element of the list was a non-zero element. I could easily eliminate choices B and D, thus making C the correct answer. For a question like this, I need to imagine trying to run the program with other test cases, and I could do this by either doing it in my head or writing it down. This way, I will be less likely to make a silly mistake and will be more likely to choose the right answer. . Question 28 . The next question to review is question 28, shown below: . . This question had two correct answers, A and C, as shown above. Even though I chose both of the correct answers, this question took me some time to do as I had to keep track of what was going on with the strings, whether they were being concatenated or being broken into substrings. Had I lost track of what was going on, I could have chosen the wrong answer, which is why I believe that this question will be an especially important one to review when we being studying for the AP exams. One way I can improve my confidence with questions like these is to write down what is happening rather than just trying to do everything in my head, as if I do it in my head, I will be more likely to make a mistake. . Question 29 . The next question to review is question 29, shown below: . . The correct answer to this question was B, which was that a, b, and c would all be evaluated to false as boolean variables. While the concept behind this question was not particularly difficult, similar to the last question reviewed, I had to keep track of everything that was happening to each variable. Whether they were being changed to true or false, I needed to make sure that I noted down which variables were true (if any) and which were false (if any). As previously mentioned, one way I can improve my ability to answer these questions with more confidence is to perhaps write it down, as I know that we will be provided with some paper for the AP exam. While it may not be necessary, especially for a computer science class, I have sometimes found it helpful when I write stuff down, as I can clearly see what is happening and am more easily able to pick the correct answer. . Question 39 . The last question to review is question 33, shown below: . . The correct answer for this question was B, which was that the MISSING STATEMENT could be replaced with REPEAT 2 TIMES so that the code segment worked as intended. Similar to some of the questions that I have reviewed for this exam and other exams we have completed in the past, the tricky part of this question was that I had to keep track of everything that was going on. For this particular question, I had to imagine the robot (triangle) following the code segment and keep track of the number of times that the robot had to follow it in order to finally reach the gray square. While doing this is not challenging, if I had lost track of where the triangle was or made it move in a different direction than what it was supposed to, I would end up 1. losing valuable time and 2. risk getting the question wrong. It is important that I learn to familiarize myself with these kinds of questions by maybe finding some online or putting emphasis on these kinds of questions to review for the AP exam, as that will definitely put me on the path to doing well. . Final Reflection/Personal Takeaways . Overall, I am very happy with the score that I earned, as it shows that I have a good understanding of what we have studied in this class so far and shows me that I can answer multiple choice questions like these really well. The questions that I reviewed here were also a learning experience for me, as it made me realize how I can approach those kinds of questions in the future to ensure that I reduce the risk of getting them wrong. I like having these opportunities to test myself on what we have learned so far and seeing how well I do, as they almost always are a true learning experience for me. These kinds of tests show me what my strengths and weaknesses are and tell me how I can improve, and I really hope that I reflect great improvement in answering MCQ questions as we continue to do more of them in the future leading up to the AP exam. .",

            "content": "Link to Full Code . If you would like to see all of the code that I wrote to create this program, you can click this link. . Video Response . Link to my video submission (YouTube) . Written Response . 3a. . 3.a.i. . The purpose of the program is to relieve the user’s boredom and entertain them by challenging them to guess a random word. . 3.a.ii. . In the video, the user plays two rounds of hangman: one in which they guess the word and win and one in which they fail to guess the word in the seven lives they were given. In the first round, the user was able to guess the correct word (HOUSE) with 5 lives remaining. The user inputted letters into the text box, and the more letters they guessed correctly, the more blanks that were filled. The user eventually guesses all of the letters correctly and is presented with the “You Win!” message. In the second round, the user was unable to guess the correct word (CONVERSATION) and lost all of their lives. The more letters the user guessed incorrectly, the more letters that were added to the list of incorrect guesses. Once the user loses all of their lives, the game ends and they are prompted with the “You Lose” message. . 3.a.iii. . The input from the video is the user inputting letters in order to guess the randomly chosen word. The output is demonstrated by the program’s response to the user’s guessed letters, which is either adding the letter that the user guessed to the blanks or adding an incorrect letter guessed by the user to the list of incorrect letters. . 3b. . 3.b.i. . . 3.b.ii. . . 3.b.iii. . The name of the list being used is called possibleSolutions. . 3.b.iv. . The data contained in the list possibleSolutions represents the possible words that could be randomly chosen for the user to guess. . 3.b.v. . The list possibleSolutions allows many words (all added by the user) to be represented by one variable. An alternative method would be to create variables for every single word in the list, which may be a large number of variables (as previously stated, all of the words in the list are added by the user). Making a variable for every word that the user adds will make the process of creating the program unnecessarily complicated and time-consuming, which is why a list is used here. . 3.c. . 3.c.i. . . 3.c.ii. . . 3.c.iii. . The procedure of this program is GameOver, which passes through two parameters, solution (string) and won (boolean, true or false). The procedure is called in the function guessLetter, which updates the letters displayed on what are initially the blanks. In the procedure itself, if the boolean variable won evaluates to true (i.e. the user has guessed all of the letters), they will be presented with a “You Win!” message. Otherwise, if the boolean variable won evaluates to false (i.e. the user has run out of lives before guessing the correct word), they will be presented with a “You Lost” message. In both cases, the correct answer, or word that was randomly chosen, is revealed. In the function guessLetter, if the boolean variable goodGuess is true (i.e. the letters inputted by the user form the word that was randomly chosen, variable solution), the procedure gameOver is called, with the solution being revealed along with the boolean variable won evaluated to true. All of these functions and parameters allow for the user to see the output that corresponds to what they input (whether the letter inputted is correct, whether they are able to guess the word before running out of lives, etc.). . 3.c.iv. . . The identified algorithm first checks whether the game is finished (as shown by finished in the conditional). If the variable finished is true, the program returns without doing anything else (does not return a value). If the game is not finished, it reads the letter inputted by the player (not case sensitive) and initializes a variable goodGuess to false. The algorithm then iterates through an array of solution letters, checking whether each letter matches the player’s guess. If the letter does match the player’s guess, the goodGuess variable is set to true, and the progress array is updated with the correct letter. After processing the guess, the updateDisplay() function is called to update the game display (i.e. fills in the blanks). If the guess was correct and the player has now won the game, the algorithm calls the gameOver() function, with the variable won being evaluated to true. If the guess was incorrect, the guess is added to an array of wrong guesses, and the player’s remaining lives are reduced by one. The updateDisplay() function is called again to update the game display, and if the player has run out of lives, the gameOver() function is called to indicate that the game is over, and the player has lost. . 3.d . 3.d.i. . Call One . The first call results from the word “Aesthetics” being guessed correctly in seven lives or less. . Call Two . The second call results from the word “Intelligent” not being guessed in the seven lives given. . 3.d.ii. . Condition(s) tested by Call One . . The user guessing the word correctly causes the above code segment to be executed, which sets the boolean variable “won” to true and the solution variable equal to the user’s progress. . Condition(s) tested by Call Two . . The user failing to guess the word causes the above code segment to be executed, which sets the boolean variable “won” equal to false and presents the user with the “You Lost” message. . 3.d.iii. .

            "content": "Summary of the Event (Presenting Our Project) . Night at the Museum (N@TM) was on February 16, 2023. There were three time slots for the different classes, and we (period 5 Yeung) had to be at the event to present our work from 6:00pm-6:30pm. We all decided to bring our laptops to the event so that we could show curious people and the teacher our final project. All of us had the opportunity to present to guests who attended the event, and the room was very crowded with teams from other periods having their laptops out. After the teacher saw our project functioning the way it was supposed to and showing our work to everybody, we all left the room to go and look at work from other electives. . Projects from Other Classes . After our time to present ended, we all went around to look at other projects for this class and other electives, such as 3D Animation, Ceramics, AP Studio Art, and many more. I was fascinated by what I was seeing and was amazed at how talented students around my age can be with their art work. I could very much see a lot of effort and dedication was put into the projects that I saw, and it overall made me feel inspired to start approaching any art-related activities with a positive mindset. . Here are pictures of some of the projects that I took at N@TM! I include some brief notes about each project and what I really liked about it or caught my eye. I hope you like them as much as I did! :) . CSP (This Class!) . Cafe Gato . . I was amazed at how detailed and interactive the frontend was | I really liked how you could not only see your review of the cafe but also reviews from other people | I was interested in how the project was able to calculate the average rating from all reviews left by others | The main purpose of this application was to entertain users with games and allow them to provide feedback on the website | . Don’t Leave Me . . I really liked the design of the website | The main purpose of “Don’t Leave Me” was to match two people up based on their personalities and other qualities | While the project was not 100% complete, it was still fun to try out and interesting to hear from the team how they created this | . Dolphin Fitness . . The frontend was very interactive and had a cool design | The teammate that was presenting did a great job at explaining to us how the project worked and at showing us a demo of the project functioning | While not 100% complete, I still enjoyed learning about the project along with other people who were interested in looking at it | The main purpose of this project was to provide users with a personal fitness plan based on their calories, height, weight, etc. | . Arcade Game . . I had the opportunity to try out the snake game, which was very entertaining | I was amazed at how the project also implemented a leader board that kept track of everyone’s score | Not 100% complete, as the teammate presenting this informed us that they were still trying to figure out how to prevent cheating, as the final scores are inputted by the user and not automatically generated; however, I still enjoyed playing around with some of the arcade games | The purpose of this project was to provide entertainment for the user with an assortment of games, such as Snake as shown in the image above | . 3D Animation . . As someone who took 3D Animation 1-2, I was impressed by how the person was able to make the donut look very realistic (probably better than mine!) | The light shined on the donut’s frosting is especially satisfying to look at | I liked how the donut was up close, as this told us that the donut was the emphasis of the project | . . I liked how detailed yet simple the chair and table were | The blue background goes well with the color of the objects | The overall scene is very realistic and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into it | . . Recalling some of the criteria for this project, I really liked how the person included chairs on all sides of the table, as it makes the scene look more “complete” (don’t know how else to describe it) | The designs of the ground and chairs makes the scene look very realistic | I especially found the shiny parts of the table pleasing to look at | . . I was amazed at how realistic the dribbling of the donut frosting was | The coffee inside the cup looks very realistic along with the glass cup itself | The background color goes well with the colors and designs of the donut and coffee | . Ceramics . . I was impressed by how detailed the face | I could tell that a lot of effort was put into the eyes and mouth | The entire thing was, simply put, satisfying and pleasing to look at with some friends | . . I liked how shiny the octopus was | The colors used go really well together | Overall, there was definitely a lot of attention to detail | . . The watering pot looks very real, which shows that there was a lot of effort put into making it look like a real one | I like how shiny different parts of the watering pot was | It was really interesting and pleasing to look at | . Design and Mixed Media (I Think?) . . Looking at this piece of art has made me amazed that there are many students who are around my age that have the talent and skill to create art like this | I liked how some parts of the hair and skin were made a bit darker compared to everything else to give off a more “real” effect | The word “race” makes me curious about what this piece is trying to convey | . N@tM Reflection . I had a really good time looking at work from not only our class, but also work from other electives such as 3D Animation, Ceramics, and Design and Mixed Media. Regardless of where the projects came from, looking at them made me amazed at how talented our generation is and how we have the ability to put out work like this. I was especially interested in the projects from 3D Animation, as I myself have taken the class and remember some of the projects that we had to do. Looking at the work from that class made me think about what I could have done better when I was in that class, which will definitely be helpful if I plan on becoming a 3D artist in the long run. I also enjoyed being able to look at all of these projects with other people, as doing so gave us the opportunity to discuss what we thought about them. Overall, N@tM for Trimester 2 was an amazing experience and I hope to attend more events like these in the future. .",

            "content": "Overview of This Blog . Around last week, I made the first blog that documented our team’s progress. With N@TM getting closer, below is how much farther we have come in terms of tangibles, what we have accomplished, problems we still have, and much more. . Words API . For my part of the project, I decided to implement a words api that I found online so that each round, a list of 10 random words is generated with one word being randomly picked from that list. The word that is picked is the word that the user will have to guess in 7 lives. Below is the code for the API, as well as what it looks like in the backend view of our project: . . . As you can see, at the end of the url is “?number=10”, which indicates that we are requesting the link to choose a list of 10 random words. One of these words will then be randomly chosen from the list created, and that will be what the user has to guess. . Subdomain Creation + Nginx Message . Originally, I believed that we were supposed to use freenom in order to create our DNS; however, a fellow CSP student sent a link to an alternative method called www.duckdns.org, which was a relief considering the fact that Freenom tends to not be consistent in when it does and does not work. I named our subdomain gamesarcade, as shown below, and upon copying and pasting the link into the web browser, the nginx welcome message shows up. Both images described are shown below: . . . GET/POST Methods . As you may recall, a few weeks ago, we had to use postman to test our APIs, and the images below show me doing just that. When I add another item (game) with the four attributes (name, desc, date, link), it adds another row to the Flask table that I created, which is what connects the frontend and backend. This is connecting the two because by adding a link attribute, the user can click on the github.io link from the backend site on to the frontend site with all of the games. . . . Issues with AWS . While our group has made a lot more progress on our project compared to last week, we still have a couple of problems that are ongoing, including the fact that the curl command does not work for our API. Below are some of the various error messages that I received whenever I tried to curl the link with our assigned port number 8034: . . Furthermore, while I don’t have images of this specific error, I also would have an error which would tell me that there was an internal server error whenever I tried to use curl. I would also sometimes get that the connection was reset by a peer, and I tried looking up solutions to both of these when each error was presented to me. I tried many different combinations of ports and checked to make sure that I was doing everything right. Not only that, but I even checked into other teams’ files to see if we were doing it right, and it looked to me that we were doing everything exactly the same, yet somehow curl only worked for them and not us. I hope that today, we will be able to find a solution to this issue and that Mr. Yeung will know what to do when we tell him that the problem is persisting. . Frontend problem . I am also having an issue with my frontend portion of the project, and it involves something within my initHangman function, shown below: . . I have tried various solutions online, but none have helped me so far. I hope to figure out why this is happening soon and that our group will be fully prepared for N@TM. .",

            "title": "CPT Progress Check 1",
            "content": "Overview . This blog serves as a status on our CPT project so far, and includes important things such as what I have done so far, what I plan to do for next week onwards, and much more. I hope that the content here helps anyone who may be struggling to think of a plan for their project. . Recap: What is Our Project? . The name of our project is called “Theee Arcade”, and it is intended to serve as an arcade for users to provide them with an immersive, fun experience. The users will have multiple games to choose from and will even be able to view a leader board to see where they are compared to other registered users. . In addition to what our project actually is, below is a table that connects what we are doing to College Board’s six criteria for the Create Performance Task: . Row on the rubric Application to my project . Program Purpose and Function | The purpose of my project is to entertain and challenge the user by having them guess a word with no hints provided. | . Data Abstraction | My project uses several lists (blanks and progress) to store the number of letters that the user has guessed correctly to be in the word (two code segments to be determined) | . Managing Complexity | The project uses lists to store the user’s entries, which is far more efficient and less time consuming than making a variable for every single entry that the user inputs correctly. | . Procedural Abstraction | The procedure update_progress uses sequencing, selecting, and iteration to keep track of the user’s progress in guessing the word. Once the progress made is equal to the word randomly generated, the user has officially won. | . Algorithm Implementation | My project will call the procedure as described above, although I will continue to figure out more ways to make the algorithm have more depth and complexity to it (not inefficient). | . Testing | A new word will be randomly generated each round with differing results for each of the two test runs (still figuring this row out as well) | . What Progress Have I Made Thus Far? . For the first week, we were given a few coding hours in class to begin working on our project for both N@tM and the CPT. The rest of this blog goes into detail on some of the tangibles that I have thus far for this week, as well as any problems/concerns that I have regarding it. . Tangible 1: Flask/JavaScript Table . Below is an image of two of the same table, with one made in Flask and one made in JavaScript. The table that is made with Flask or JavaScript is clearly labeled at the top of each table: . . The table made above serves almost as a menu of games for the user to choose from once they go to our main arcade page. It will kind of resemble an entrance to a real life arcade. When the user gets to this page, they will be able to see the name of each game, the description of each game, and when the game was made. While this is not visible in the image above, I will also be adding a column that includes the link to each game in the table. Once the user clicks on the link to whatever game they choose, they will then be presented with the main page corresponding to that game created by one of us (ex. they could be brought to the Hangman page created by me!). . What I am Concerned About . While I have a pretty solid idea on how I want to implement this table into our project, I am concerned about how I will make the table look nice when it is presented to the user. Even though design should be the least of my worries at this point, I still would like to make those who test this application excited when they first look at the page with this table. This way, they will be more drawn into the games and will look forward to seeing how everything works out. In addition to the “cosmetics” of table, I am also worried about figuring out how to add the borders to the table so that it looks like an actual table, but this should hopefully be an easy fix. . Tangible 2: JavaScript Code . Last week, I showed some sample code that I wrote in Python that I plan to use for my CPT project. This week, I have the same code performing the same functions but in JavaScript, and this is the language that I plan to use in creating the actual page for my part of the project. If you would like to see the video of the code segment running, you can click on the image of hangman below, where you will see a few test runs of the project. . . Explanation of the Video + What I am Concerned About . While the functionality demonstrated in the video is pretty self-explanatory, there are a couple of things worth nothing. The blanks list is what allows you to see the number of blanks in the output box that corresponds to the number of letters in the randomly chosen word from word_list. I also added the user_input.lower so that it does not matter if the user inputs an upper case or lower case letter. Once the user has guessed all of the letters in the word correctly, the code will exit and the user will be presented with a “You Win!” message (might be a separate screen for the real deal). . One problem that I have with this, however, is that the randomly generated word begins with much more blanks than it really has, which could mislead the user into thinking that the word is really long. I have tried changing certain lines of code, mainly the lines regarding the blanks array, but no matter what I do, I either I have one big blank or many small blanks, which is an issue that I hope to resolve by the end of this week. For me to fix this issue, I will need to use Google or consider asking my teammates for help or, just in case, I could ask Mr. Yeung or Mr. Mortensen and walk them through what I have tried to do. . Plans for Next Week Onwards! . This week is looking to be a very busy week, as we have multiple work days according to the schedule on the APCSP blog. With the very busy week that we have ahead of us, as well as the week after leading up to when we present our N@tM project, we plan to get a lot of things done with our project. Below are some things that we would like to finish for the week of February 6 to February 10: . Getting our project deployed (AWS): In order for us to connect the frontend and backend portions of the project, we need to deploy our flask on AWS so that the process of the data being collected and stored can occur without error. We hope to get this done pretty early in the week, as we will likely be expected to have both parts connected by the end of this week. | . . Begin working on our actual pages (using family reunion repo): Now that our entire team has the code that we would like to use ready to go, we need to actually create the pages that the user will see depending on which game they choose from the table mentioned earlier in Tangible 1. For our frontend portion of the project, we will be using Mr. Mortensen’s Leuck Family Reunion as a template/starting point for our project, and we hope to have all, if not most of our pages created by the end of this week. To recap, this is what the default template for Mr. Mortensen’s family reunion looked like (we will make many changes to this and may even do a before and after kind of thing!): | . . Style the flask/JavaScript table (will decide which one I want to use): As mentioned earlier, I created two of the same table, with one made in Flask and one made in JavaScript. While this will likely be done last, I do believe that it is important that I consider the overall “cosmetics” of our project to demonstrate that some effort was put in to making the website look nice and not just into the code. Below is an example that I could take inspiration from in styling my able in CSS/HTML/JavaScript: | . . Overall Reflection . I will continue to make these blogs that document the progress that we make each week (or even day!), as this way, people who are on my team can have a review in front of them of what we have done and what we still need to do. I also feel that these blogs will be useful for myself, as if I ever want to look back at a project like this and see what led up to this, I can always turn to these progress blogs to see how we built up to our final project. Clearly, from doing this blog, I realize that I have some strengths and weaknesses in what we have so far. For me personally, some positives are that I have a plan on how I would like to implement my tangibles, I know what code I will be using, and I have a good idea of what I (as the Scrum Master) should do to get our team to complete what we want to complete. Some negatives, however, are that compared to other teams, we may be a bit behind, as we do not quite have our actual pages/features on the family reunion just yet. However, we will make sure that we will use the time in class to finish that part of the project so that we will not have to wait until the last minute to finally put something out for N@TM. .",

            "content": "Overview of This Blog . Over the past few weeks, we have had class discussions (and will continue to have more) about various topics within the computing world, such as computing bias, the digital divide, and crowd sourcing. . 5.1 . 5.1: Class Discussion .

After our class discussion, we were asked to think of our own forms of computing (not discussed), with each one including some of their benefits and drawbacks. Three things that require and involve computing that I thought of were autonomous (self-driving) cars, data collection/analysis, and medical devices. . (1) Autonomous (Self-Driving) Cars . Benefits . Improves road safety: Self-driving cars are equipped with advanced technologies that allow the car to make safe driving decisions in accordance to the current situation, which reduces the likelihood of accidents typically caused by human error. | More free time for passengers: Since the car is driving itself, the people inside will no longer have to worry about taking the regular precautions of driving (eyes on the road, no distractions, etc.). This allows them to spend more time on other things, such as working, relaxing, or talking to other passengers. | Lower fuel consumption/less emissions into the atmosphere: Since these cars are equipped with advanced technology, they can be programmed to maximize fuel efficiency and minimize emissions released into the air, as they have the ability to make precise, efficient driving decisions. | . | Drawbacks . More expensive/costly: Although self-driving cars provide many benefits to its consumers, it costs much more compared to regular cars, which might make people who are interested have less of an incentive to buy something that is more expensive. | Security risks: Since self-driving cars is built of a lot of advanced technology and is computer programmed, this makes them more vulnerable to hacking and cyber attacks, which could compromise the car’s system and put the passengers inside at risk. | Software malfunctions: As self-driving cars rely on advanced technologies and software, some of these technologies may malfunction or not work as intended, which can lead to accidents or other problems on the road, thus putting the passengers’ lives at risk. | . | . (2) Data Collection/Analysis . Benefits Improved accuracy: Computers can be very useful when it comes to collecting/analyzing data, as they can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, reducing the risk of human error that can lead to inaccurate conclusions. | Increased scalability: Since computing can handle large amounts of data from multiple forces, this allows organizations who use computing to scale their data collection and analysis as needed. | Automated data collection/analysis: Computers have the ability to automate the data collection, analysis, and reporting process, which reduces the need for manual data entry and analysis, which is much more vulnerable to human error (ex. inputting a data value wrong, switching the results of two experiments, etc.) | . | Drawbacks Privacy risks: Although computers can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, this is what raises privacy concerns, as all of that data could be sensitive, personal information that is collected, stored, and analyzed. | Bias: With computers, some of the algorithms used for data collection and analysis can be biased or in favor of one thing, which may not be perceived as a set of very credible results to users seeking unbiased results. | Too much reliance on technology: The more that organizations rely on computing for data collection, the more that they will depend on it for the future. This can lead to them not being able to do their jobs without it, which can make the organization fall apart. | . | . (3) Medical Devices/Equipment . Benefits Improved accuracy: Medical devices and computing technologies can improve the accuracy of diagnoses and treatments by providing more accurate data and reducing the risk of human error. Thus, computing in terms of medical devices leads to better patient outcomes and improved quality of care. | Data management: Medical devices combined with computing technologies can help manage and store large amounts of patient data, improving the efficiency of data analysis and decision-making. This leads to an overall better use and allocation of resources. | Personalized medicine: Medical devices and computing technologies can support the development of personalized medicine, which tailors treatments to individual patients based on their unique needs. This leads to an improved approach of treating patients and a better understanding of what they are in need of. | . | Drawbacks Complexity: Medical devices and computing technologies can be difficult to understand for some people, requiring specialized skills and training to use and maintain. This can result in difficulties in use and maintenance, and can also make it more difficult for healthcare providers to integrate the technology into their existing systems. | Ethics: The use of medical devices and computing technologies can raise ethical dilemmas, such as privacy and the use of artificial intelligence (A.I.) in medical decision-making. | Human error: Despite technological advances, human error can still occur during data entry, analysis, and interpretation, leading to incorrect diagnoses and treatments. Even though computing can help with making the process of treating and diagnosing patients much more efficient, doctors should still be trained to know what they are doing should anything involving human error occur. | . | . (4) Our Project (Theee Arcade) . Benefits Entertaining: This can help the user pass time if they are bored or have nothing to do. | Helps with stress: This game can help relieve stress for the user if they are stressing about something, such as school work or other issues | More friends: Since we plan on implementing a leader board into our project, the user can talk or chat with fellow players and make friends with them. | . | Drawbacks Distracting: Although our project can be used to relieve stress and help the user pass time,, it can also be very distracting and cause them to forget about their real life. | Security concerns: As we will have a login and sign up page for our project, the user risks their privacy/security by providing the boxes their name,email, etc. and also by chatting with other users online that they don’t know or have never seen in person. | Addictive: Although this overlaps with distracting, the user could end up playing our games for several hours throughout the day that they end up losing time to sleep or do other daily tasks. | . | . 5.1: Dopamine Question . After reading the information provided about Anthony Rosner, who was very addicted to games, and from personal experience, the dopamine issue is definitely a real thing that can happen to all of us. Some people get distracted by different things, such as video games, social media, and music, just to name a few. For example, whenever I listen to music, I always find that it energizes me and makes me feel more motivated to complete my work. At the same time, however, I can get distracted from the music, as it always makes me want to get up and move around, which wastes valuable time that could have been spent completing homework or studying. Because I end up wasting time, this forces me to stay up late to complete all of my assignments/study, which gives me less time to sleep and makes me feel tired during the day. Another thing that I have noticed distracts me is that whenever I start working on something right after watching a show or video, my brain cannot stop thinking about it, which makes me less concentrated on the work in front of me, which also leads to many of the same things that listening to music causes for me. Overall, from my many personal experiences, the dopamine issues are definitely real and can cause people to lose focus on what they are supposed to do. . 5.1: Internet Blockers + Admin Passwords Question . One pro of internet blockers is that it protects students at school from dangerous websites, which will prevent them from risking the security of their device. Another pro of internet blockers at school is that it protects student from viewing inappropriate content or something else that can be distracting, which allows the students to focus more on their learning in class. While internet blockers have their positives, they also have their negatives. One con of internet blockers is that they sometimes block websites that can actually help students learn, especially in fun ways, which can cause the students to feel bored when in class. Another con of internet blockers is that they do not give students the opportunity to learn how to use the Internet responsibly and safely, which is important especially in a field like computer science. . One pro of the lack of admin passwords at school lab machines is that it allows the admin to login easily without having to type anything in. One con, however, is that by not having a password, the admins put themselves at risk for hacking or having their account hijacked, which can jeopardize the entire school administration system. For the lack of admin passwords, the cons probably outweigh the pros, as there are many security risks associated with it. . 5.1: Personal Takeaways/Reflection . I learned a lot from the class discussion, listing benefits and drawbacks and computing, and also talking about dopamine issues. I liked the idea of the class discussion, as I was able to hear from many people about their ideas and perspectives on the world of computing. As I was listing off some of the benefits and drawbacks of computing, I had to do some research online to find out more about them, and I was astonished by what I was looking at. It was amazing to me how much of what we do relies on technology, which can be somewhat concerning, as if we one day end up in a situation where we cannot use technology, many people will not be able to do much because of how much they depended on computing to complete their daily tasks. I also feel that this lesson allowed me to share my personal experiences and helped me realize what I can do to improve my habits and get less distracted on technology, which I (along with MANY people) rely on so much in my daily life. . 5.2 . 5.2: Class Discussion (The Digital Divide in Computing) . Discussion Not everyone has access to forms of technology (laptops, tablets, cell phones, etc.) Some people cannot afford it | Some people may live in certain countries who impose certain restrictions or restraints on certain technology (ex. divide between what is allowed in China and what is allowed in America) | Some may live in areas or countries that have little access to technology | . | Factors for why not everybody uses technology includes… Some may not have access to the latest update on their laptop, cellphone, etc., so their knowledge of technology may be more limited | Some may choose not to for religious reasons (ex. Amish) | . | . | . 5.2: Questions . (1) How does someone empower themselves in a digital world? . One can empower themselves in a digital world by applying their creativity and realizing that the sky is the limit when it comes to the digital world. When someone is more creative, they will have more of an incentive to experiment and play with a lot of things, and in that experimentation, they will likely find something that fascinates or excites them. Thus, when someone motivates themselves to be creative, especially in the digital world, they will be able to discover things that they had no idea about and will feel more empowered to maybe pursue a career in the digital world. For example, from personal experience, I feel a lot more empowered in the world of computer science than I did several months ago. When I look back at all of the work that I have done for this class, I realize that I was able to accomplish that because of how much I played/experimented with the sample programs provided. When I played around with certain parts of the code segments and changed or even rearranged certain lines around, I was able to look at results that I did not even know were possible, and that is what has made me much more motivated to pursue my aspirations in computer science in CSA and beyond. . (2) How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . One who is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by talking to the non-empowered person about how they overcame certain challenges and obstacles in their life and provide them with words of encouragement. By the empowered person telling their story, the person who is not empowered will feel inspired to accomplish the same and therefore more motivated to pursue their interests that may have previously been held back. For example, I have an older brother who is currently at UCSD (CS major!), and like me, he took a lot of AP classes in high school. Whenever I don’t feel confident enough in my abilities, feel burnt out (which is always), or am worried about grades, he always tells me ways that he dealt with it when he was in my position. He would also remind me of what I have already accomplished, which is what motivates me to do the very best I can with the heavy workload I am having to endure. Something that I can do at Del Norte High School to help people feel empowered is to maybe start a club that allows students to come together and voice their concerns about anything in a safe environment. This way, there will be a sense of collaboration/working together when figuring out how to empower ourselves, which is exactly what we need. . (3) Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Whether or not paper or red tape is blocking digital empowerment mainly depends on the specific context. In some cases, paper can slow down our ability to adapt to changes with new technology and make it difficult for us to embrace the advancements. In other times, however, paper may be necessary to use for certain tasks to accomplish things such as maximizing efficiency and ensuring security and privacy. For Del Norte specifically, paper could be viewed as a barrier to digital empowerment, as there are certain activities that are done on paper that could be completed much more efficiently, quickly, and accurately on our computers. For example, in AP Chemistry, if we are ever doing a lab experiment, we usually have to handwrite a data table along with its necessary columns and rows for us to write down the results as we go. However, if we were given the option to complete the table on a device, we would be able to make tables that are much more neat, precise, and easy to make, as in applications such as Google Docs, we can control how many columns and rows we want and write out (type) what we want to include much faster. We would be able to keep track of data more quickly, which saves a lot of time from having to pause the experiment just to write down what we see. . (4) What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . One concern that I have about the digital divide is that as technology becomes more advanced/updated that the digital divide will continue to expand. This can cause people who may not be fortunate enough to have access technology to feel isolated or left out from those who do. As peoples’ dependency on forms of technology is growing, it is possible that people who don’t have technology will be viewed as outsiders or weird, which goes back to how that can cause them to feel excluded from everyone else. Overall, my concerns about the digital divide are mainly social, as I am worried that there will be many people who feel excluded or ostracized from the rest of society because they don’t have access to forms of technology while everyone else does. . 5.2: Personal Takeaways/Reflection . This lesson taught me a lot about how many people around the world have their own reasons for not using technology. Some people may not use technology because they live in an area where it is not accessible, while others may not use it to not go against their religious beliefs. Some people may not have technology simply because they cannot afford it. I also felt that this was another opportunity for me to discuss my personal experiences, which made the lesson a lot more interactive and overall more relatable for me. I hope that when I look back on this blog to study for the AP exam that my answers for both this and 5.1 will serve as useful study tools to both myself and others who look at my blog. . 5.3: Computing Bias . 5.3: Class Discussion . Age Groups for Facebook vs. TikTok Generally speaking, TikTok has been intended for young adults/teenagers while Facebook has usually found use from older generations | While Facebook is considered more of a place to get important information about today’s world (politics, sports, etc.), TikTok is more of an app that is meant to entertain its audiences (funny compilations, tutorials, jokes, etc.) | The younger generation may not find Facebook as appealing and the older generation may not find TikTok as appealing | This exclusion could be harmful, as it may be stereotyping that no teens use Facebook at all or that no older adults use TikTok at all, as there are indeed some that do even if it may not be the “intended age” | This could be corrected by having both apps include content that could be entertaining/interesting to both age groups and not just one or the other | For the businesses, having this exclusion would be profitable for them; for example, if TikTok has a lot of content meant for teens/young adults, many people in that age group will likely watch more of that content, which paves these businesses the way to earn a lot of money from users | . | Virtual Assistants Having Female Voices Some people may simply believe that the female voice sounds better or more pleasing, hence why many assistants like Siri or Alexa have female voices | The people who were testing the virtual assistants may have found in their testing that the female voice was more appealing compared to the male one, which would allow more users -&gt; make more money -&gt; better to use female voice assistants | Some people may even connect this back to the history of our world, stating that many men believed that women were always “assistants” and were not part of the main job that men had | This kind of computing could be harmful in that it promotes sexism, as it may be implying that only women can be considered voice assistants and that one gender is more superior than the other | While Google, Alexa, Siri, etc. gives one the option to choose other voices, the female one is always the default voice | Adding on to the testing point, some of the people working for the businesses with these virtual assistants may have found the female voice to be the most time-efficient and cost-efficient solution | . | Algorithms that Influence Our Decisions Some algorithms, such as Netflix, Google, Apple, etc. will use forms of advertising in order to grab the user’s attention | Some algorithms may exaggerate their product in order to make the user watch more of that type of content | For Netflix specifically, when a user watches shows/movies of the same kind of genre, Netflix presents the user with a “You Might Also Like” category, and along with that, it shows the % match | When a user watches certain content that all converges towards a specific genre, the user will have more advertisements/recommendations for that kind of content (ex. Youtube Algorithm) | The more we see these recommendations, the more we end up wanting to watch it, which further triggers the algorithm | Sometimes, on Google, we will see someone or something that is “trending” along with a symbol that shows an arrow pointing downwards, and this is based on what many users have watched or searched up recently (brings us into crowd sourcing, 5.4!) | . | . 5.3: “HP computers are racist” . (Below are both notes from the class discussion and my own answers to the questions) . (1) Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? . After watching the video and observing the owner’s reaction, the owner definitely believes that this was intentional. This is seen by how he explains to the viewers what he has tried to do and how he even asks his co-worker (who is white) to try it out herself. He seems very shocked that while nothing happens when he is in front of the camera, when the co-worker comes into view, everything works as it should and only stops when he gets into clear view of the camera. Although at first glance it may look like that the creators of this product intentionally did this, I personally don’t believe that this was done on purpose and was simply a designing and testing error on their part. . (2) How do you think this happened? . There are several reasons that could explain why everything played out in the video the way it did. Below are some that I thought of and also gathered ideas from when we discussed this in class: . Design: The computer tested in the video was likely not designed to detect people that have a color scheme that is different from a color that is lighter or closer to white. Because of the producers’ failure to fully check the design of the computer and to make sure that it worked for anybody who came into view, whenever the owner tried to get the camera to detect him, nothing would happen. Meanwhile, whenever the owner’s co-worker tried to get into the camera, the computer worked just fine, indicating that the creators mainly tested on white subjects or people with lighter skin, hence limiting the computer’s ability to detect those with darker skin. . | Testing: While this computer may have been tested on/had trial runs, most of the tests were likely conducted with white subjects or people who have lighter skin. Because of how limited the diversity of the test subjects were, this could have caused the computer to be “confused” or to not do anything whenever the owner (who has darker skin) came into the camera’s view. One way that this could have been avoided would be to also test the computer on people with darker skin/different color schemes, as this way, the creators of the computer can make any adjustments accordingly before officially releasing it to the market where everyone can use it without an issue. . | . (3) Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Should it be corrected? . While the creators of the HP computer likely did not intend to offend anybody, the computer can be harmful in that it could mislead the consumers into thinking that this was indeed done on purpose. Being misled can spark many other unnecessary problems or conflicts that are a result of a simple misunderstanding or testing/design error on the producers’ part. I personally don’t believe that this computer was intended to be harmful/exclude or cause offense to anybody, but rather what was shown in the video was a result of a design flaw. This should definitely be corrected, as if the producers of this computer do not do anything to fix this issue, more people might be mislead into believing that computers are racist and that it was intentionally made to exclude or prevent them from using the product. As a result of more people being upset/outraged by this error, this can escalate the situation much more than it needs to be, which can cause harm to people who may not even be aware of this problem or other groups of people. . (4) What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? . If I was the one of the people who was designing/testing this computer, I would improve the computer to have a better outcome in several ways. To begin with, I would gather many test subjects of a variety of racial backgrounds and have them sit in front of the camera to see if it does anything. Based on the results of that trial run, I (along with my hypothetical team) can make necessary adjustments to the computer and test it again to see if the change improved the overall outcome. I would continue testing the computer over and over again until I can clearly see that it works for anybody regardless of their skin color. By testing it numerous times and making adjustments, this will ensure that the product will be released into the market for anybody to use without any malfunctions as a result of a testing error. Another way that I would improve this computer would be to design the computer so that it can withstand many different levels of lighting and can detect anyone regardless of how light or dark it is. In the video, one of the things that the owner tried to do was to get closer to the camera (which of course did not work), which demonstrates a faulty design. Similar to testing the computer with people of many backgrounds, I would improve the design by testing the computer in rooms that each had a different lighting and have someone in each room test it out. Based on all the trial runs/outcomes of each test, I can make any adjustments accordingly so that the best possible product is sent out into the market for people to use. . 5.3: Personal Takeaways/Reflection . I found this lesson to be quite interesting, as I was able to hear from many people about their perspectives on computing bias and why some of the kinds of biases we talked about continue to exist today. I especially liked it when we would connect the discussion back to our personal experiences, as not only were we able to get a productive class discussion, but we were also able to get to know each other as classmates, which was what definitely made this lesson more fun and entertaining overall. For me, I think that the most interesting part of this lesson/discussion was the portion about computers being racist, as there were so many reasons to why that error occurred and it also made some people (including me) laugh a little bit, and I think that it is important to have a little fun when it comes to discussing things like these. . 5.4: Crowdsourcing . 5.4: Class Discussion . Benefits/Positives of Crowdsourcing Can obtain multiple perspectives on the same thing | We can draw similarities and differences in how people responded/reacted | Based on data collected, we can draw conclusions about how we as people think, respond, react, etc. in certain situations | We can see if there are any variations/notable outliers in the data | Overall, we can get a LOT of information from crowdsourcing, which can be helpful when we are interested in collecting data about people with social experiments, surveys, controlled environments, etc. | It can help us consider multiple perspectives on the same thing, may overall improve society | . | Drawbacks/Negatives of Crowdsourcing We don’t know for certain if people were honest or if they were lying in their responses/reactions | We can’t guarantee that everyone answered/did everything honestly | For surveys specifically: if we want to know how people respond to a question, while some may give a valid answer, some may simply not care about the question and instead put something that is irrelevant to the subject matter For example, if the question asked the user how often they wash their car, some may give a valid response such as “once a week” or “once a month”, but some may give responses that won’t be useful for fulfilling the purpose of the survey, such as “once every 30 seconds” or “i dont know i dont care” | One of the main issues of crowdsourcing is that it may make the data collected inaccurate, which can lead to incorrect conclusions/takeaways | By crowdsourcing, people are giving away their personal information, which can raise a security/confidentiality risk | Because crowdsourcing involves collecting a large amount of data from a large number of people, this makes bias/unequal representation more likely, which does not set the stage for a reliable study | . | . 5.4: Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing + Questions . (1) We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used. . While taking this class, I have had the opportunity to experiment and play around with some APIs. There were a few APIs that my group and I tested last trimester for our N@tM project. One API that caught our eyes was the Calender API, which was what allowed users to add events to calendars for any day, month, or year. This fit right in with what we wanted to do with our project, as we wanted to make a calendar that did just that by having the user click on a few buttons before submitting their new event. The problem with that API was that it was only limited to the terminal when the project was supposed to be more interactive and be more vibrant and interesting when first looked at. To solve this problem, we created our own calendar API that allowed the user to input a day, a month, the name of the event, and the description of the event. We took inspiration from Mr. Mortensen as he showed us his Jokes API and Covid API, which helped us a lot in figuring out how to connect the frontend and backend parts of our project. Making our own API helped us in the end, as it was what made the process of adding an event more interesting and pleasing to those who tested it out. . (2) We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub? . The biggest discovery that I have found in Github is that you can see what days that a viewer made commits to any of their repositories, no matter how long ago it was. Not only does it tell you when they worked, but it also shows you how much work they did, which is indicated by how dark the green square is. The lighter the green square, the less work that was done, and the darker the shade of green, the more commits that were pushed that day. For me personally, many of my squares are medium to light green with some white squares, which indicates that I commit somewhat rarely. As Mr. Mortensen and Mr. Yeung will begin to check our commits, I want to improve how the squares look by attempting to commit at least once a day, as this way, it will show that I did do some work for every day of the week. This is a great example of how crowdsourcing can influence our decisions, as by looking at how often I make commits, I now realize that I should be committing much more often than I do now, which I will begin to work on starting now. . (3) Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting? . When I was looking at some of the datasets displayed on Kaggle, I found it interesting that many of the data sets in the top 10 to top 20 are familiar to me and probably many other people, as we use these data sets very often in our daily lives. Some of the data sets I saw included Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, which makes sense, considering how we use these apps for entertainment, enjoyment, or even education (i.e. podcasts, documentaries, Crash Course). Seeing these apps in the top 10 or top 20 does not surprise me very much, as I know that many people around the world use them as their main sources of entertainment. . (4) CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . One way that I could do crowdsourcing for our environment is to conduct a class survey to gather opinions, thoughts, and suggestions from my classmates about a particular topic or issue. I would initiate this survey in our environment by having everybody stop working and ask them to take a couple of minutes to fill out a survey about a topic or issue. I would also request everyone who participates to answer honestly in the survey, especially for questions that require them to write a few sentences. While crowdsourcing this way could help me understand the topic from multiple perspectives, there are several drawbacks of doing it in this method. Some of these setbacks include… . Not answering honestly: Some students may be afraid of answering something a certain way, so they will feel more compelled to put down an answer that may not reflect their true beliefs or thoughts regarding the topic. This can cause me to obtain data that may not be accurate, which could lead to me making incorrect conclusions. | “Invalid” responses: Some students may not want to waste their time answering questions on a survey, so rather than actually taking the time to think about their responses to each question, they will put down something that is irrelevant to the topic in order to be done with the survey. This will cause me to have less responses that I can actually use to form my conclusion from conducting this survey, which will ultimately make the evidence (responses) be weaker and considered less credible. | . Overall, when it comes to my crowdsourcing idea, it is important that I take into account both the pros and cons of the method of crowdsourcing, as by doing so, I will know what to do when I am presented with certain responses. . (5) What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . For Del Norte crowdsourcing, I could do something similar to what I talked about in my previous response for crowdsourcing for just our APCSP classes. I could perhaps create a Discord server and use forms of social media such as Instagram to get people to join. Once I have a large enough sample size for my survey, I can send the link to the survey for everyone who has joined the server and have them fill out the form regarding the particular topic or subject matter. With a much larger and much more inclusive sample size (students from all grades would be able to take this survey), I could have much stronger evidence that leads me to my conclusion and can understand the topic from multiple different age groups. Our project could be improved with crowdsourcing, and we are thinking about this by considering adding a leader board that shows some of the top players of the games we put out. Some of the leader boards could include average time it took for a user to guess a work, the highest number of countries guessed in 30 seconds, etc. Based on all of the rounds that a user has played, the leader board will in some way take all of those rounds played and find out the average time, points, etc. Based on this average, the user will be placed on to the leader board accordingly. . (6) What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . One way that I could capture data is to allow those who come by to our project to play the games that they want to play. We could let them play a round or so of Hangman, Guess the Countries, etc. and maybe have them guess how we got the games to turn out like the way they did. This allows for a more interactive experience between the developers (us) and the users (those who come at N@tM), thus making the evening more interesting. Before N@tM, our group could even have the teachers do the same thing and ask them the same questions, which will make the teachers more interested in our project and more excited for us to present it at N@tM . 5.4: Personal Takeaways/Reflection . I also found this lesson very interesting and entertaining, as there are so many ways that one could initiate crowdsourcing. I felt that this lesson gave me the opportunity to recap on what I have done for this class in the past, as things such as APIs and even GitHub uses forms of crowdsourcing in order to function in the way that they do. I like reading about studies/surveys conducted regarding a certain topic and find the process of collecting data from humans interesting in general, so having a class discussion about this really allowed me to channel that and overall have an entertaining time talking to other students about crowdsourcing. . 5.5: Legal and Ethical Concerns . 5.5: Class Discussion . Copyright Discussion Benefits Ensures that people are credited/recognized for their work | Ensures that nobody else can steal another person’s idea and publish it as their own | Promotes the distribution and use of creative works | Creates an incentive for creators to produce more works knowing that they are gaining an exclusive right to their content | . | Drawbacks Some people may use copyright for malicious purposes (ex. someone may strike someone with a copyright infringement on YouTube even if the content was not originally there) | Someone who came up with an idea may not know about copyright, so someone else may steal that person’s idea and impose copyright, imposing the idea as their own | Could restrict creativity | . | . | Licensing Discussion Benefits Can provide the owner of the property with a source of additional income, as they receive royalties or fees for allowing others to use their property. | By granting licenses, the owner of the property can enable others to use it and promote its widespread dissemination. This can increase the visibility and value of the property. | Licensing can help the owner of the property to reduce the risks associated with commercializing their property, as the licensee assumes some of the responsibilities and risks associated with the commercialization of the property. | Licensing can provide the owner of the property with access to expertise, resources, and infrastructure that they may not have otherwise, as the licensee may bring these to the table as part of the licensing agreement. | . | Drawbacks Owner of the property gives up a certain level of control over how the property is used, which can reduce the ability of the owner to enforce their rights and protect the property from misuse or infringement. | Depending on the terms of the license, the owner of the property may have to pay royalties to the licensee, which can reduce their overall revenue. | The terms and conditions of the license may limit the use of the property, which can limit its potential value and impact. | By granting a license, the owner of the property may lose their exclusivity over the property, which can reduce its value.

Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. | MIT License Benefits Open-source license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute one’s project as long as they credit them and license their derivative works under the same license. | Simplicity and wide adoption | Places minimal restrictions on users | . | Drawbacks Lack of any patent protection | Since the MIT License places little restrictions on users, there is a possibility that they may misuse or abuse the project in ways that the owner does not intend or approve of | . | . | Apache License 2.0 Benefits Permissive open-source license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute project as long as they comply with the license terms. | Has patent protection | Compatibility with other open-source licenses. | . | Drawbacks May be more complex than the MIT License, which could provide users less of an initiative to implement this type of license | The patent protection provided by the Apache License 2.0 may not be as strong or reliable as some users may want Can be a drawback for projects that rely a lot on patents | . | . | . | GPLv3 Benefits Requires users to release the source code of any derivative works they create using one’s project | Strong protection of the rights of users | Promotes collaboration and sharing | . | Drawbacks May limit the use of the project in commercial settings | Users may not always comply with the license or may not be aware of their obligations under the license | . | . | BSD License Another permissive open-source license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute one’s project as long as they retain the copyright notice and license terms Benefits Simplicity and wide adoption | Imposes minimal restrictions on users | . | Drawbacks Like the MIT License, the BSD License does not offer patent protection | The permissive nature of the BSD License may result in a lack of restrictions on how your project is used, which can lead to misuse or abuse by some users (again like MIT License) | . | . | . | . In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. | In this discussion, we talked about the different aspects of software licensing and copyright, including the benefits and drawbacks of various license types, the importance of considering digital rights and ethical considerations, and the legal protection provided by copyright. When choosing a license for a software project, it is important to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of each license type, such as the simplicity and wide adoption of the MIT License, the patent protection and compatibility with other open-source licenses offered by the Apache License 2.0, the strong protection of user rights provided by the GPLv3, and the minimal restrictions placed on users by the BSD License. It is also important to be mindful of the impact your license choice may have on users and to ensure that the license aligns with your goals and values. In addition to software licensing, we also discussed the concept of copyright and the legal protection it provides for the creators of original works. While copyright can help to prevent unauthorized copying and distribution of work, it can also limit the ability of others to use and build upon existing works and the complex nature of copyright law can make it difficult to enforce compliance. In conclusion, when creating and distributing software or other original works, it is important to understand your rights and responsibilities under both software licensing and copyright law. By carefully considering the benefits and drawbacks of different license types, being mindful of digital rights and ethical considerations, and understanding the legal protection provided by copyright, you can ensure that your work is protected and used in a way that aligns with your goals and values. . Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. | For our project, our team is currently deciding on two licenses: the MIT License and the Apache 2.0 License. While both licenses are important in giving users the right to use other peoples’ material (complying with the license guidelines, of course), both of them have their benefits and drawbacks. Below are overviews of what each license is, the benefits and drawbacks of each one, and the kind of positives/problems we might experience with each: . The MIT License allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software, as long as they provide attribution to the original creators and do not hold them liable for any damages. This license is known for its simplicity and wide adoption, which can make it easier for users to understand and comply with. Additionally, the MIT License allows for commercial use and distribution, which can be beneficial for businesses and individuals looking to monetize their software. On the other hand, the Apache 2.0 License is a permissive license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software, as long as they provide attribution to the original creators and include a copy of the license in any distributions. This license also includes a patent protection clause that can provide additional protection for users and contributors. Additionally, the Apache 2.0 License is known for its strong protection of user rights and its compatibility with a wide range of other open-source licenses, making it easier for users to integrate and use the software in their own projects. In making a license choice, we will need to consider the goals and values of the project, as well as the intended use and distribution of the software. For example, if we wanted to encourage collaboration and community involvement with our project’s code, the Apache 2.0 License may be a good choice. However, if the team wants to monetize the software, the MIT License may be a more appropriate choice. In conclusion, choosing the right license for a software project is an important step in creating and distributing software responsibly. By carefully considering the benefits and drawbacks of different license types, being mindful of digital rights and ethical considerations, and documenting the license choice in the project documentation, we can ensure that our software is protected and used in a way that aligns with our goals and values. . 5.5: Personal Takeaways/Reflection . I found our discussion regarding legal and ethical concerns of computing quite interesting, as I have always asked myself many questions about this aspect of computer science. I was always familiar with copyright placed on songs, art, or other forms of work, but I never really considered computer science to also fall into there. Through talking to other people about their thoughts on the legal and ethical concerns of computing, I was able to look at this topic from multiple angles and understand where everyone was coming from. I especially found the part in which we were talking about who is most vulnerable to being jeopardized by these patents/copyright laws. Many people said that the older generation or people who live in areas that do not have access to computers are most vulnerable. However, if one thinks about it, this can happen to anybody, as anyone can have a lapse in their judgement that could cause their work to not get the credit and recognition that it deserves. . 5.6: Safe Computing . 5.6: Class Discussion . Googling yourself discussion May find images of people who have the same first/last name | May find images/videos of people if they have a linkedin or YouTube channel with published videos | . | Adult googling May find results for jobs | Linkedin | . | What one would not want to have available online One’s password (BIG) | One’s home address | One’s IP address | Family | Phone number (unless maybe for business inquiries) | Email (see phone number) | High School/College attended | . | PII Protector/Security Methods Discussion Windows Defender | Two-factor/multi-factor authentication: not only requests for the username and password, but also sends a text message or email to the user to ensure that it is really them logging in | Firewall | Antivirus on the computer | Facial recognition/finger print ids | People from the older generation, people who may not be familiar with computers, who people who may have lived in an area that did not have access to computers may be more vulnerable to security risks | Symmetric and asymmetric encryption | . | Security Concerns Discussion Viruses or forms of malware (ex. malicious files on the computer, Trojan Horses, etc.) | Phishing - can be used to get a virus on your computer or make you provide PII | . | . 5.6: Reflection Questions . (1) Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . Throughout the time that I have taken this class, I have experienced many examples of me having to input PII. For example, when we were making our AWS accounts, we had to include our first name followed by the initial for our last name. We also would have to type in our name and other personal information when we were testing out Mr. Mortensen’s CRUD application with the table. We also had to input PII when we created our Github Account. For me personally, I enabled two factor authentication whenever I logged into Github, as this way, Github would know that it was really me who was trying to log in. . (2) What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . While I don’t have any public videos or pictures of me on YouTube, I do have some old pictures of myself on other social media sites such as Instagram. Although the account did not have very many followers, I still feel that in some way, personal information about myself is still available for anybody to see, including people that I don’t know at all. I feel that it is essential that we are careful when it comes to doing things that involve PII or to be aware if someone is trying to trick you into revealing personal information about yourself. Otherwise, if we blindly give PII to random people, they could use our data for malicious purposes that we have no idea about, thus why it is important that we try to keep our PII to ourselves as much as possible. . (3) Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . A lot of the times, websites will tell us what a strong password is and what it should consist of. For the most part, “strong” or “good” passwords consist of 8-10 characters and include letters, numbers, symbols, and other stuff. Some websites may even tell you if the password you have right now is strong or weak so that you can adjust it accordingly. For me personally, a good password is a password that will be easy for you to remember while not making it super obvious for someone who is planning to hack your account. It is also important that we don’t use the same password for everything, even if it is because it will be easier to remember, as doing that may make you more vulnerable to getting your account compromised. Bad passwords are usually passwords that don’t have enough of the criteria mentioned earlier for a good password. Bad passwords are passwords that are super common and make it easier for a hacker to get into your account. . (4) Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . In simple terms, symmetric encryption uses only one key to encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption uses multiple keys to encrypt and decrypt data. . (5) Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . AWS deployment often uses server-side AES 256 encryption for information, and hashes information to-and-fro when routing requests. Thus, information is kept secure. . (6) Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . I have not learned about phishing schemes the hard way, but one weird site was a site that automatically downloaded some items to my computer when I was young. I was very scared at the time and have always thought about that when surfing. Some phishing techniques include scams from friends, scams from providers who may not have the same, email, etc. . 5.6: Personal Takeaways/Reflection . I found our discussion regarding safe computing quite interesting, as I have always asked myself many questions about this aspect of computer science. Through talking to other people about their thoughts on safe computing, I was able to look at this topic from multiple angles and understand where everyone was coming from. I especially found the part in which we were talking about who is most vulnerable to being presented with security risks such as malware, viruses, and phishing. Many people said that the older generation or people who live in areas that do not have access to computers are most vulnerable. However, if one thinks about it, this can happen to anybody, as anyone can have a lapse in their judgement that could cause themselves to be unaware that they are putting their computer/machine in danger. . Overall Reflection . I thought that all of these lessons were great learning experiences for me, as I was able to discuss these concepts with other students, share some of my personal experiences and relate that to what we are talking about, and also allow me to give my opinion on some of the most debateable topics in the world, including the benefits/drawbacks of computing and the digital divide in the world of computing. In addition, both of these lessons gave me the opportunity to think about our project more and how we can incorporate some of the ideas that we learned. By considering some of the ideas that we learned about in the world of computing, our group could definitely refine our project further and have it be in the best condition for when we present it at N@tM. I am looking forward to any more of these lessons that we will have and hope that they too will serve as a memorable, interactive learning experience for me and even other students in this class. .",

            "title": "College Board MCQ Test 2 Corrections",
            "content": "Overview . This blog shows some of the questions that I either got wrong or forced me to think about the answer for a little while before getting it right. It also goes into detail on questions I got wrong and what I can do better to not make that same mistake on a question like that for the future. . My Score . The final exam was 50 questions for a grand total of 50 points. I earned a score of 45/50 (90%), as shown below: My overall score indicates that I showed a relatively good understanding of what we have been learning through College Board. The questions that I got wrong were questions 17, 21, 22, 27, and 30. . Reviewing Questions I Got Wrong . Question 17 (wrong) . The first question to review (that I got wrong) is question 17, which is shown below: . . There were two correct answers, which were A and D. Although I selected A as one of the correct answers, because I selected B, which is not a correct answer, I did not get the point for this question. I knew for sure that A was one of the correct options, as I knew that the result would be the same as the one in the question if val1 and NOT val2. I likely chose option B, however, because I thought that there would be no need for nested conditionals (if/else statements) when this is not the case. I probably thought that by having two different if statements that the result would still come out to be the same. The next time I get a question like this, I will make sure to read the lines of code for each option given and to remember how nested conditionals work and how boolean variables work, as forgetting something like those concepts on the actual AP exam could result in me getting what is supposed to be a simple question wrong. . Question 21 (wrong) . The next question to review is question 21, which is shown below: . The correct answer for this question was D, which was that nothing would be displayed because the program is in an infinite loop. I chose answer C, however, and looking back at this question, I can clearly understand how and why I made this mistake. I thought that since the segment inside the “repeat until” started at i = 1 that it would actually go to i = 4; however, what I didn’t realize as I was doing this question is that the variable i is always going to have a value of 1 and is never going to reach i = 4. Therefore, the program gets stuck in an infinite loop and will not display anything. One way I can prepare myself better for a question like this is to be mindful of what is inside the conditional (or in this case, “repeat until”), as reading that portion carefully will inform me of whether the program gets stuck in an infinite loop or not. . Question 22 (wrong) . The next question to review is question 22, shown below: . The correct answer for this question was C, which was that both algorithms yielded the correct average height in the classroom. For this question, I was likely having a difficult time trying to understand was Algorithm B was saying, which probably drove me to believe that Algorithm B would not calculate the correct average and that therefore only Algorithm A does. When I now look at how I got this question wrong and reread both algorithms, I now understand and am able to visualize how each of the algorithms worked. I now know that Algorithm B was essentially having each pair add up the values on the cards and repeating this process until there was only one student left standing, and how dividing that result by 32 will give the same correct average as Algorithm A. For a question like this where it does not have code and is all in words, I can improve my ability to answer these questions correctly by really reading the algorithms carefully and make sure I know how to visualize what is happening. This way, I will be less likely to make the same mistake that I made when I answered this question. . Question 27 (wrong) . The next question to review is question 27, which is shown below: . The correct answer to question 27 was D, as shown above. I actually had a difficult time understanding what this question was asking, as I struggled in deciding which answers to eliminate and which answers were possible correct ones. As I am looking back and reviewing this question, I am starting to understand where I went wrong, but I have still not 100% understood this question to the point where I can answer a very similar question like this correctly. One way I can improve myself in this area is to watch some of the College Board videos (also shown in the image above) that relate to questions like these, as those videos will definitely help improve my ability to answer a question like this and teach me how to approach them. I definitely learned a lot about myself and my understanding of this topic from this one question, and I believe that this will help me become better prepared for the upcoming AP exam. . Question 30 (wrong) . The last question to review (that I got wrong) is question 30, shown below: . . This question had two correct answers, where were choices B and C. While I did choose C as one of the correct answers, the other answer I chose was A, which was not one of the right options; thus, I did not earn the point from this question. I knew that C was a correct answer, as I knew that the code segment provided would just go from the circle with the largest radius to the circle with the smallest radius and produce the picture as it is given in the question. I chose A and not B as an answer, however, as I did not take into account where the line of code “drawCircle(x,y,r)” was written. Me getting this question wrong was mainly due to me not carefully reading EVERY single option given, as when I saw option A, I immediately jumped to conclusions and believed that it was the right answer and did not consider the fact that there could be options in which the line of code drawCircle(x,y,r) is placed differently in the program. The next time I get a question like this, I will make sure to read all of the answer choices, even if there are some that are obviously wrong, as there could be an answer that you skipped that ends up being the right answer. . Reviewing Questions That I Got Right, But Took Me Time to Figure Out . While reviewing questions that I got wrong on this test is essential, it is also important to consider questions that took me time to figure out or required me to really think, even if I ended up getting the question right. This section reviews questions . Question 5 (correct) . The first question to review is question 5, shown below: . I ended up choosing the correct answer for this question, which was B, shown in the above image. Question 5 involved swapping the values of variables a and b using temp as the temporarily variable. Although the concept of this is very straightforward, I had to ensure that I was keeping track of what was changing and what was being kept the same, as losing track can lead me to pick the wrong answer on a question that is fairly easy to answer. For a question like this, I can improve my confidence in answering it correctly by perhaps writing everything down, as it can sometimes be difficult to try and do everything in your head. This way, by writing down what is happening on a piece of scratch paper or something to write on, I will be more certain about which answer is correct and be able to move on to the next question without any hesitations. . Question 12 (correct) . The next question to review is question 12, shown below: . While I did choose the correct answer, just like question 5, I needed to make sure that I understood what each variable represented and that I did not lose track of each variable’s description, as doing so could have led me to pick the wrong answer. For a question like this, I can minimize the amount of time it takes for me to think about what the answer is by jotting down a few notes or even words about each variable’s description. This way, by labeling each variable with specific key words, I will be more likely to remember what each variable represents and therefore will reduce the possibility of me answering the question wrong. . Question 29 (correct) . The next question to review is question 29, shown below: . I chose the correct answer for this question, which was option A, where the robot or triangle was essentially in the middle of the set of squares. I ended up almost choosing a wrong answer (D), as I initially thought that the robot always repeated every movement three times. Thankfully, however, I realized that each time the robot performed the set of movements that they end up repeating it one less time than previously, which is shown in the last line of the code segment that has “n &lt;- n-1”. Had I not realized this, I could have gotten this question wrong. This question required me to imagine the robot moving along each of the squares, and I had to be much more cautious compared to other questions that involve swapping the values of variables. For a question that involves robots moving along a grid or something similar, it is important that I understand the code segment given (if any) and how that contributes to the functionality of the program, as while keeping track of the robot’s movement is critical, it is also just as, if not more, important to understand concepts regarding code, as that understanding can also have an impact on if I get the question right or wrong. . Question 37 (correct) . The next question to review is question 37, shown below: . For this question, I chose the right answer, which was B (the drawing that looks like a 3). Although the concepts related to this questions are fairly straightforward, this was also another question in which I had to carefully keep track of everything that was happening in the procedure. Since it can be difficult for me to draw out the line segments in my head and keeping track of everything, I used a whiteboard to help me see what the length of each line segment was as well as each one’s direction. I found this very helpful, as I was able to compare the drawing I made to the drawing options presented, and I immediately knew to choose B as the answer, as my drawing ended up looking like a 3. I heard from Mr. Mortensen that on the AP Exam MC, we will be provided with some scratch paper if needed throughout the exam, which will definitely be a useful tool when it comes to questions like these and other questions reviewed here. . Final Reflection/Personal Takeaways . Overall, I am very happy with the score that I earned, as it shows that I have a good understanding of what we have studied in this class so far and shows me that I can answer multiple choice questions like these really well. The questions I got wrong were also a learning experience for me, as it made me realize how I can approach those kinds of questions in the future to ensure that I do not make those same mistakes again. I like having these opportunities to test myself on what we have learned so far and seeing how well I do, as they almost always are a true learning experience for me. These kinds of tests show me what my strengths and weaknesses are and tell me how I can improve, and I really hope that I reflect great improvement in answering MCQ questions when we have our multiple choice final for this trimester. . College Board Suggestion :) . Although this is not the most important thing, I think College Board could improve something when it comes to multiple choice tests such as the one I just took. I noticed that after I submitted the test that they only provide explanations for some of the questions and not all of them, especially questions such as the ones I got wrong or took me some time to think about. I wish College Board could add explanations for correct and incorrect answers for more of those questions, as this way, I will immediately know why I got the question wrong and how not to make the same mistake again. I understand that it is important to review the question ourselves, but it can sometimes be difficult to understand why you got a question wrong if you do not understand it in the first place, so College Board adding an explanation would be useful to students like me. .",

            "title": "Individual CPT Outline/Plan",
            "content": "Overview of Our Project . The name of our project is called “Theee Arcade”, and it is intended to serve as an arcade for users to provide them with an immersive, fun experience. The users will have multiple games to choose from and will even be able to view a leader board to see where they are compared to other registered users. On Thursday, we were to present our project idea to the class, but due to the time constraint of 3-5 minutes, we were not quite able to say everything that we wanted to present. This blog serves to talk about our project but in more detail, with heavy emphasis on my individual part of the project. . Team Member Roles . We have assigned each member of our team a page of the project for them to complete so that everybody’s CPT submission will be different but still be based on the same idea. Below is a table that shows the team members, their roles, and their part of the project that they are to complete: . Team Member Scrum Team Role Assigned Part of the Project Purpose . Christopher Albertson | Frontend Developer | Guess the Number! | To help everyone learn their numbers in a fun way. | . Prasith Chilla | Backend Developer | Sports Jeopardy | To entertain the user by having them answer questions regarding sports for points. | . Vyaan Gautam | DevOps | Tic-Tac-Toe | To provide the user with an immersive, fun experience by allowing them to play against a fellow registered player or even a computer player. | . Emaad Mir me) | Frontend Developer | Hangman | To entertain the user and allow them to expand their vocabulary in a fun way. | . Chinmay Ramamurthy | Scrum Master | Guess the Countries | To challenge the user by testing their knowledge of countries around the world and seeing how fast they can name countries that start with a certain letter. | . My Part . Now that you have had the chance to look at what my other teammates are doing, the rest of the blog will focus solely on what I am doing and what my plan is for my part of the project. . Wire Frames/Rough Draft . Below is a model of what I want the Hangman page to look when the user views it (please excuse the terrible Google Drawing, this is just to give me an idea of how it should appear): . . In this VERY rough model, you can see that at the very top, there is a link to every single game that the user can play (mine in bold to indicate that this is for the hangman page). This is essentially how we want to present the other games to the users if they decide they want to play something else. For my page specifically, I plan to have the blanks displayed as well as a letter bank so that the user knows which letters they have already guessed. The hangman will also be shown, with more body parts (head, arms, legs, etc.) appearing as the number of incorrect guesses increases. While this is not specifically in the rough model above, I also am thinking of implementing a time elapsed clock (no time limit, though), as the time taken to guess a certain word would fit well with the leader board that we want to include. . Sample Code . Below is an image of a code segment in Python that basically shows how I want the hangman game to function (only limited to terminal for now). While this may not be a submission that could earn full credit for the Create Performance Task, it definitely meets some of the main College Board criteria. Comments are added to explain not only what the line does but to also show how it could meet the criteria: . . Sample Code: Explanation . While the functionality of the code is pretty self-explanatory, there are some thing worth noting about the above code segment. The blanks list is what allows you to see the number of blanks in the output box that corresponds to the number of letters in the randomly chosen word from word_list. I also added the user_input.lower so that it does not matter if the user inputs an upper case or lower case letter. Once the user has guessed all of the letters in the word correctly, the code will exit and the user will be presented with a “You Win!” message (might be a separate screen for the real deal). . Application of CRUD . A few weeks ago, Mr. Mortensen had a tech talk about CRUD and its importance in view and frontend coding. To recap, here is what each of the letters in CRUD mean: . C - Create | R - Read | U - Update | D - Delete | . Here is how my specific project follows each of these: . Create: Each round, a new word for the user to guess will be randomly chosen from a list, and the blanks and progress made by the user will be initialized as well. | Read: A new letter will be added to the blank if the user guesses a letter correctly, and if the user guesses incorrectly, the number of lives remaining will decrease/the number of incorrect guesses will increase. | Update: If the user guesses a letter correctly, the letters displayed on the blanks will be updated. If the user guesses wrong, however, there will be one more body part of the man that will be hanged. | Delete: For every letter that the user guesses, that letter will be crossed out or removed from the provided letter bank. Once the user has won and guessed the word or has lost all of their lives and lost the game, a new game will be made with another random word generated. | . Application of College Board Criteria . Here is how the sample code above meets the criteria and how it will meet the criteria that it has not quite yet met: . Row on the rubric Application to my project . Program Purpose and Function | The purpose of my project is to entertain and challenge the user by having them guess a word with no hints provided. | . Data Abstraction | My project uses several lists (blanks and progress) to store the number of letters that the user has guessed correctly to be in the word (two code segments to be determined) | . Managing Complexity | The project uses lists to store the user’s entries, which is far more efficient and less time consuming than making a variable for every single entry that the user inputs correctly. | . Procedural Abstraction | The procedure update_progress uses sequencing, selecting, and iteration to keep track of the user’s progress in guessing the word. Once the progress made is equal to the word randomly generated, the user has officially won. | . Algorithm Implementation | My project will call the procedure as described above, although I will continue to figure out more ways to make the algorithm have more depth and complexity to it (not inefficient). | . Testing | A new word will be randomly generated each round with differing results for each of the two test runs (still figuring this row out as well) | . While I am still in the process of figuring out how I can apply my project to the rubric, I believe that what I have right now is a good start and that I will continue to build off of what I have so far leading up to N@tM and when the CPT is actually due. . Plans for the Video . When we were grading the sample CPT submissions for the past few weeks, we saw many videos of the submissions’ code working, with the written response describing what was shown in the video and beyond. . For my project, there are several things that I will need to show in my video submission. Below is again the rough model of my page created earlier, as that will likely be the first thing that the graders see when they look into my submission: . . Some of the things that will likely be necessary for my video include… . A screen that gives the user an option to press the “play” button (or something similar) | Once the user (me) has pressed play, a screen similar to the rough model above will be shown. | Showing me choosing a letter from the word bank and seeing if the letter turned out to be a part of the word or not | Showing the number of chances/lives that I have remaining | Showing specific messages for the user depending on if they have won or lost a game | My video will likely run this program twice, each with different results: One in which I win the game | One in which I lose the game | By winning one game and losing another, the graders will be able to at least see what each screen would look like for every possible result | The graders can also see what it looks like when a new round has started/new random word is generated | . | Showing the parts hanged being added to the hanger if I guess a letter incorrectly | The “You Win!” message or “You Lost! The word was (word)” message | Overall, the video should show the user input, output, and functionality associated with the program that will be described in the written response | . As mentioned before, I am still trying to figure everything out, but some of these bullets will definitely be taken into consideration when I get to making the actual video submission for the Create Performance Task. . Things I am Happy With/Concerned About for My Part of the Project (So Far) . While we are not expected to have the final project ready at this time, there are several things that I am happy with and am looking forward to when I create my project. However, there are also some aspects that I am concerned about implementing/incorporating into my CPT submission. . What I am Happy With . My code sample does actually meet some of the College Board Criteria, and this will definitely be helpful as the deadline for our CPT begins approaching | I can describe in enough detail how my code works, which will be important when I write my written response | My wire frame for the project actually gives me a great idea of how I want everything to be presented to the user and will be a good reference to keep with me as I make more progress on it | . What I am Concerned About . Although what I have thus far is a good start, I am worried that the end product will not have enough depth or complexity to it (not necessarily inefficiency), which can be problematic if I want to get full points on the CPT | My sample code mainly lacks algorithm implementation, and I am concerned that I will not be able to properly incorporate that into the final submission and that I will not be able to describe it in enough detail so that someone else could recreate it | With games such as Hangman, there is no complex mathematical algorithm that goes into fulfilling the overall functionality of the program, as most of it just involves words or letters. I am therefore worried that by not having some mathematical component involved in the algorithm, my algorithm will not include the necessary sequencing, selection, and iteration, thus preventing me from getting the point for that row. | . Reflection . Overall, even though there are several setbacks and limitations to the plan that I have, what I have so far is a great start and is definitely something that I can work with so that it can be improved or more refined. I will make sure to clear up the concerns that I have by maybe researching algorithms that go into making these kinds of games and using it as a source of inspiration (and citing it, of course). By doing this, I will feel much more confident about incorporating the algorithm into my program and modifying it so that it has more depth to it. While my part of the project is very important, my teammates also have their own projects to work on, and I will make sure that I help them if needed, as we will all need to present our parts for N@tM. In essence, I think I have a great idea for how I want my program to turn out in the end and can explain how it meets the College Board criteria to someone who may not be familiar with how the project was made, the rubric, or even both. .",

            "title": "Videos Explanation/Reflection",
            "content": "Overview: What Am I Talking About? . This week, we were all assigned to use what we learned from the tech talks about API/Control and Database/Model to create two videos that demonstrate the following: . Videos . API/Control Video . Includes create and read API endpoints for the project | Tests the api endpoints with test cases in Postman (adding entry, removing entry, etc.) | Frontend for Create and Read endpoints | No more than 30-60 seconds long | . Database/Model Video . Shows the use of sqlite extensions/command line to update data in the table (adding and/or removing rows) | Shows that you created your own .py file (for me, it was games.py) | No more than 30-60 seconds in length | . So, How Was the Experience? Difficult? Really Easy? . For the most part, as shown in both of my videos, I was able to demonstrate everything asked for while staying within the constrained time frame of 30-60 seconds. However, I experienced many challenges as I made my way through this week’s hacks, but with what I was able to turn in, I think the challenges helped me learn a lot about myself. . Challenges . Challenge 1: Having to Get the New Version of Flask . During the tech talk that Mr. Yeung gave about Postman, he demonstrated copying and pasting the link into whichever request it was, whether it was GET or POST (this is also shown in my API/Control video). Many people, including me, began to notice how Yeung’s port number (8086) was different from ours (5000). It turned out that the version of flask from the last trimester was old, and we would need to clone the repository with the new version of flask. Thankfully, this was not too difficult of a task, but I found it interesting about how there was now a completely new version of flask with a new port number. . Challenge 2: Link to Application Would Show Error . Right after cloning the repository, I made sure that my python interpreter was set to base (anaconda) and that I had flask installed using the command pip install flask. However, upon clicking on the link given in the terminal, I came across this error: . . When I asked Mr. Yeung about it, he told me that I needed to follow the instructions in the readme file in the new version of the flask application. Thankfully, when I followed the instructions, the application showed up like it should have, shown below: . . I began to notice, however, that each time I open VSCode (before it was previously not on), I end up having to follow the exact same steps over and over again. Fortunately, the more times I did it, the less work it was to me, and it ended up becoming much less of a burden over time :). . Challenge 3: Many Rows Would Be Added to the Table Unintentionally . When I began to work on adding data to the table and list on the web application, I noticed something very strange. First off, the class I created was a Games class, with three attributes: name, description, and date made. Previously, I had two entries in the table, with both being Hangman. Sometimes, however, if I tried to add something else that was not hangman (POST) and made a GET request proceeding the POST request, not only did it add the new entry, but it also added multiple Hangman entries at the same time, making most of the table filled with the exact same information about Hangman (10 times). Thankfully, once I realized how to make a delete request (which also took some time!), I was able to remove all extra entries and make it so that only the entry I made a POST request for would show up after the GET request. . Challenge 4: Debugging Mode . One of the things we had to do for the database video was that we had to show a debugging session. However, whenever I tried clicking the “Run &amp; Debug” button in the main.py file, I would always get that there was a syntax error of some sort within the main.py file. I tried looking up the error on several forums such as stack overflow and GitHub issues. I ended up adding rows to the table in an alternative way, which was adding entries using the games.py file, which worked as expected. Next time, I will make sure to ask questions about the debugging mode so that I can do everything as asked and assigned by the teacher. . Reflection . As shown by the three challenges above, I did not have an easy time completing this. However, I think that these challenges really helped me learn a lot, and I hope that the two videos I made will serve as a helpful study/recap tool for both myself and other students taking this class. Even though the process was quite rough, I still enjoyed the feeling I got when I was able to get everything working the way it was supposed to. Also, if I ever play Hangman, I will always be reminded of doing this project! . .",

            "title": "CPT Submission Scoring Set 3",
            "content": "Submission 1 . Reporting Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The student earned the point for this category because they describe the purpose of the function being to entertain the user and describes the functionality and the input and output of the program. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The response did not earn the point for data abstraction, as while they do show a code segment with the name of the list, their second code segment does not show that same list being implemented into the functionality of the program. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response did not earn the point for this reporting category because the list that the student includes does not manage complexity. In addition, in their written response, they provide an inaccurate explanation for why the list they use could manage complexity, as the program could be created just as easily even without it. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 0 | The response did not earn the point for this category because while it does show a student-developed procedure,they do not mention in their written response how that procedure contributes to the functionality of the program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | This response earned this point because their algorithm includes sequencing, selecting, and iterating and also explains how the algorithm works in enough detail so that someone could recreate it. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The student earned the testing point, as they pass two different arguments, describes the two different conditions that the runs are being tested in, and describes the two different results. | . Discrepancies Between my scoring and CollegeBoard Scoring (1) . For the most part, my scoring agreed with that of College Board’s, which is a good sign that I am continuing to improve my judgement when I am looking at these sample submissions. However, there was one discrepancy between our scoring, and that was for the procedural abstraction category. For this category, I was actually quite hesitant to award the response the point, as I thought that it did not go into enough detail about how the procedure works. However, I ended up deciding to give them the point, as I thought that they at least did the bare minimum for their written response portion. College Board, however, did not agree with this, as even though the response includes a student-developed procedure with parameters, it does not explain how the procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program, thus not earning the response the point for procedural abstraction. To improve from this discrepancy, I will make sure to really read what is in the written response and try to see if I myself could recreate the procedure being described (by thinking about it of course). This way, I will know right away if the response deserves the point or not. . Submission 2 . Reporting Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | This response earned the point for this reporting category, as they properly describe the purpose, functionality, and input and output of the program. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student earned the point for this category because they include a list as one of their program segments, as well as another code segment that demonstrates how the list is being used to fulfill the program’s purpose and functionality. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | This response earned the managing complexity point because they include a code segment that manages complexity of the letters the user types in and explains (accurately) how much more difficult it would be to write the program if they did not use the list specified in the written response. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 1 | The student earned the point for this category, as they include their student-developed procedure with the necessary parameters and explain how the procedure and its functionality contributes to the functionality of the program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student earned the point for this category, as they go into great detail about how the algorithm works, which allows someone who is reading the description to recreate the algorithm themselves. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The student earned the testing point, as they pass two different arguments, describes the two different conditions that the runs are being tested in, and describes the two different results. | . Discrepancies Between my scoring and CollegeBoard Scoring (2) . Similar to the first submission, my scoring and College Board’s scoring was the same for the most part. However, the one discrepancy between our scoring was from the procedural abstraction category. I likely made the mistake of not awarding the point because of how I scored this category for the last submission I scored. I had made the mistake in assuming that the response did the bare minimum, but College Board did not agree. I must have thought that the student did not include enough detail about how the procedure fulfills their program’s purpose, so I therefore did not award them the point. College Board did award them the point, however, as they meet all of the necessary requirements on the rubric. Next time, I will make sure not to let a previous scoring distract me from the submission I am scoring right now, as the whole point of the scoring should be to improve your judgement of what submissions are good and bad. This way, I will know exactly what I need to do to get full credit on the Create Performance Task. . Submission 3 . Reporting Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The response earned the point for this row, as they are able to distinguish between the purpose and the functionality of the program. They also describe the input, output, and functionality as demonstrated in the video submission. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 | The student did not get the point for this row, as there is no code segment that demonstrates data being used from the stateList.They also give an inaccurate description regarding the code segment containing the name of the list, stateList. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | Even though the response includes a code segment that manages complexity with a list, in the written portion, it gives very generic reasons for why it would be difficult to create the code without a list (would take much longer, be very inefficient, etc.) | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The student did not earn the point for this category because despite having a student-developed procedure, their procedure does not have at least one parameter. Additionally, the second code segment does not show the procedure updateScreen actually being called. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The response did not earn the algorithm point because it includes sequencing and selecting, but it is missing iteration. Furthermore, the written response does not specify how the index value is set based on the match and what value is set for each U.S. state. | . Testing | 0 | 0 | The student did not get the response for this row because rather than describing two calls to the procedure, they describe two calls FROM the procedure. Also, they describe two conditions being performed by the user rather than the conditions being tested by the parameter. Additionally, the response does not specify the two calls to the given procedure and simply describes the result that shows up on the screen. | . Discrepancies Between my scoring and CollegeBoard Scoring (3) . There was only one discrepancy between my scoring and that of CollegeBoard’s, and that was for the data abstraction point. When I looked into the sample response for data abstraction, I was debating quite a bit on whether the response should have earned the point or not. This was because I was not sure if the different lines of code was supposed to represent data being used from the list. Additionally, I was not paying attention to the fact that the student’s description did not match what one of their code segments showed. The code segment shows that the list stateList is representing the state name, but in the written response, it describes how the list represents the information that the user will see about whichever state they choose. Although I can see that I am able to decide if a response for a certain category is good or bad, I still need to work on comparing what is shown in the code segment to what the user writes in their response. This way, I will know if both line up with each other and will help me to not make the mistake of having the code and written response contradict each other when I do my own Create Performance Task. . Submission 4 . Reporting Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The response did earn the point for this category because they state the purpose of the function (to lessen boredom), demonstrates running of the program in the video (movement of boat as user presses keys), the functionality of the program (score keeping), and describes the input (pressing ‘a’ and ‘d’ keys) and output (boat’s left and right movement). | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This response earned the data abstraction point because they show two code segments that meet the criteria: one that shows data being stored in the list and one that shows data being accessed from the list in a loop. The response identifies the name of the list (fishtypes), and specifies what is stored in the list (type of fish, number of specific fish caught). | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response earned the complexity point because it includes a code segment that manages complexity with a list (about the type of fish and the number of each type of fish caught). Furthermore, the response accurately explains how the code could be written without lists and specifies how little changes need to be made to the program if another fish was added to the list. They compare this to not using a list, which would force them to make a new variable for every fish that was added, which makes the program far more inefficient and therefore unnecessarily complex. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student earned the procedural abstraction point because they include a student-developed procedure (clone+movement+range) with five parameters (more than just the one required) and a call to this procedure. Additionally, they describe the functionality of the procedure and how it is able to fulfill the program’s overall functionality and purpose. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | This response earned the point for this category because the algorithm includes sequencing, selecting, and iterating. Additionally, the response explains how the algorithm works in enough detail so that someone else reading the description of it could recreate it themselves. | . Testing | 0 | 0 | The response did not earn the point for the testing category, meeting none of the three criteria. The response did not describe the arguments passed through the parameters, and although it did describe the conditions being tested, it does not correspond to how the parameters are implemented in the program. Additionally, rather than describing the result of each call, they only describe the code segments for each call. | . Discrepancies Between my scoring and CollegeBoard Scoring (4) . Fortunately, there were no discrepancies between my scoring and that of CollegeBoard’s, which to me is a great sign that I understand what CollegeBoard considers to be a good or bad submission for the Create Performance Task. Although I was hesitant for some categories in scoring this response, I made the right choices whether it involved giving or not giving them the point, as all of my choices matched those of CollegeBoard’s. For example, I was hesitant on if I should have given the response the testing point, as I was not sure if they had actually described the results of each call of the fishing program. Much of their response regarding the results appeared to talk more about the code segments that are involved rather than what is actually outputted. Otherwise, I would say that I felt more confident in my decisions for the other rows. . What my CPT Program Will Need + Criteria . To recap, below are the six criteria that CollegeBoard will be looking for in my Create Performance Task: . Program Purpose/Function | Data Abstraction | Managing Complexity | Procedural Abstraction | Algorithm Implementation | Testing | . In order for me to get a full score on the CPT, my submission needs to meet all six of these criteria. While I do not have any finalized ideas for what I am going to for my CPT (yet), below are a few that I have brainstormed and thought about for quite some time: . Some kind of fun game that can also help the user learn something | Program that allows a user to track their daily activity, water intake, food intake, etc. | Maybe a program that takes a data set and calculates the mean, median, mod, standard deviation, etc. | A program that lets a user of things that they want to collect | A program/series of pages that behave as an arcade full of games (hangman, matching game, etc.) | . Regardless of what I end up doing, my program needs to meet these six criteria . Why a Submission Might Not Meet a Standard . While the program not functioning like intended can be a reason that a submission fails to meet a standard, what the student includes in their written response can also be the reason. If the student is not being specific about the program purpose, function, algorithms, etc., it is likely that CollegeBoard cannot award them the point for being vague. Another reason could be that the submission shows that the student did not thoroughly look at the rubric themselves to make sure that they met all the criteria. Without reading the rubric, one cannot be for certain if they have met a standard, which is why it is always important to review the rubric before getting started on the project. This way, you will not have to start from scratch if you find out that it does not meet the criteria on the rubric. . Final Reflection for the Last Scoring . I felt that I learned a lot from looking at and scoring these sample submissions. First, by scoring more and more of these each week, I was able to improve my ability to distinguish between a response that should earn a point and a response that should not. I also was able to get a better idea on what CollegeBoard believes is a good or bad example of the Create Performance Task submission. Additionally, I learned from much of my mistakes ever since I first began scoring these, and I could see this happening from how there became fewer and fewer discrepancies between my scoring and CollegeBoard’s scoring. Most important of all, I can now apply what I have learned from scoring these myself to what I am going to do for the Create Performance Task, as I now have plenty of samples to look back on and to ensure that I can get full credit on each category. Lastly, I could see myself get better at really looking at the written response and comparing it to the code segments embedded into the response, as looking at both told me if the student understands what their code does and if they made sure that what they were saying was actually true. Understanding how your code works is certainly an important skill in both this class and beyond, as this informs people that you not only put work into the project but that you also took the time to make sure that you know what you are doing. .",

            "title": "OOP Hacks Explained",
            "content": "What is OOP? . Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a really useful way of allowing us to give one variable multiple properties. One way to think of this is programming a video game. If you wanted to create the villain or main character, you would want to assign them as an object, or “class”. Within this class, you could give the objects multiple characteristics/attributes about themselves, such as their powers, intelligence, stamina, strengths, etc. Overall, OOP allows us to write code that is cohesive and easier to follow. . Important Note #1: Defining the Class . This is the code segment that can be found at the very top of my finished hacks, shown below: . . Although there is not a whole lot to look at from just this segment, there a few things worth noticing. For instance, if you look at all of the “self.” lines, you will see how the periods are followed by an underscore. The underscore is there in order to make the variables used (arguments inside def_init_) protected to that one class. By doing this, if a user wishes to make more classes, they can continue to reuse the same variable with different elements as long as that variable is protected to each of those classes. If the underscore was not there, this would cause the definition of the variable to change, making the code very messy and unnecessarily complex. . Setters and Getters . During the lecture, you may have heard the teacher discuss something about setters and getters being used in the code they showed. Here are some simple definitions for setters and getters: . Setter - Setters not only set the value of a attribute, but they also allow you to change or update the value of the attribute, if desired. Getter - The definition is pretty much said in the name, but getters are what get the value of the attribute which was previously set by the setter. . Some of the code specifically involves the use of setters and getters, as shown below as an example: . . Output . If you took a close look at what was in the output, you may have noticed that an asterisk would appear next to a user’s name, as shown below: . . The asterisk is there to tell you that the computer has printed out the value of certain attributes for Chinmay. If I decided to pass u1 and u1’s password as the parameters after users, then an asterisk would appear next to Emaad. . Conclusion . I really hope that this was helpful to people who are/were confused about these hacks even after completing them. I hope that this may be a helpful tool in making the written responses for the Create Performance Task, as knowing what your code does and being able to explain its functionality is a crucial skill for this class and beyond. .",

Discrepancies Between my scoring and CollegeBoard Scoring . For the most part, my scoring was the same as that of CollegeBoard’s, including in categories such as program purpose and function, managing complexity, and algorithm implementation. There was one criteria, however, in which or scoring did not match, and that was for the category Data Abstraction. While I awarded the submission the point, CollegeBoard did not. I thought the response earned the point because I believed that the two code segments they included showed how data was being stored and how it contributed to the overall functionality of the program. CollegeBoard, on the other hand, did not award the point because the response includes a list that is not actually being used. This discrepancy was likely caused by mistake in automatically assuming that the two code segments were valid and met the criteria. Next time, I will make sure to look at the code segments more thoroughly to get an accurate conclusion of whether the response should get the point or not. . Submission 2 .

Discrepancies Between my scoring and CollegeBoard Scoring . For the second submission, there were no discrepancies between my scoring and CollegeBoard’s scoring, as the table shows above. The fact that my scoring agreed with CollegeBoard’s tells me that the more of these submissions we will have to review and grade, the more our judgement improves over time. In the previous set of CPT submissions, there were several discrepancies between our scoring of the responses, but for this set, I can definitely see more of our grading match. . Submission 3 . Reporting Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | This response did not earn the point for this row of the rubric because they describe the functionality of the program rather than its purpose. The other five criteria, however, were met. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student earned the point for this category because their written response includes two valid code segments regarding data being stored and identifies what is being stored in the list. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response earned the point for this reporting category because it includes a code segment that manages complexity and gives an accurate explanation of how the code would be written differently without the specified list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response earned the point for this reporting category because it includes a student-developed procedure with multiple parameters and goes into great detail on its functionality. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student earned the point for this response because they have a procedure that includes sequencing, selecting, and iterating, and they also go into enough detail about how the algorithm works so that someone else could recreate it. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The response earned the point for this category because it describes two different calls to the procedure, the conditions being tested, and the results of each call. | . Discrepancies Between my scoring and CollegeBoard Scoring . Like the second submission, there were also no discrepancies between my scoring and CollegeBoard’s scoring. This tells me that I am continuing to improve myself in how I score the responses and shows that I am getting a better grasp of the rubric for the Create Performance Task. . Submission 4 . Reporting Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 |   | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 |   | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 |   | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 |   | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 |   | . Testing | 1 | 0 |   | . Discrepancies Between my scoring and CollegeBoard Scoring . My scoring and CollegeBoard’s scoring for the most part was the same in reporting categories such as Procedural Abstraction and Algorithm Implementation. However, there were also a few categories in which our scoring did not match. One of these categories was data abstraction. I thought the submission earned the point, as I thought that the code segment demonstrated how the word list from the first segment fulfills the program’s purpose; however, CollegeBoard did not award the response the data abstraction point, as the second code segment only reveals the length of the list and not how it is incorporated into the program’s purpose. Another category in which my scoring and CollegeBoard’s scoring did not match was the testing category. I gave this submission the point, as I thought that the two test runs demonstrated two distinct arguments causing different parts of the code to execute. CollegeBoard did not think the same way, however, as rather than passing two different arguments, the written response only describes the conditions in which the runs are being tested, thus not earning them the point. For this category, I believe I mixed up two different arguments with the two different conditions, as I (for some reason) thought that they could be used interchangeably. One way to improve myself from this is to understand important vocabulary that the rubric includes so that I understand what certain words mean and if they can really be used interchangeably or not. . What my CPT Program Will Need + Criteria . To recap, below are the six criteria that Collegeboard will be looking for in my Create Performance Task: . Program Purpose/Function | Data Abstraction | Managing Complexity | Procedural Abstraction | Algorithm Implementation | Testing | . In order for me to get a full score on the CPT, my submission needs to meet all six of these criteria. While I do not have any finalized ideas for what I am going to for my CPT (yet), below are a few that I have brainstormed and thought about for quite some time: . Some kind of fun game that can also help the user learn something | Program that allows a user to track their daily activity, water intake, food intake, etc. | Maybe a program that takes a data set and calculates the mean, median, mod, standard deviation, etc. | A program that lets a user of things that they want to collect | . Regardless of what I end up doing, my program needs to meet these six criteria . Why a Submission Might Not Meet a Standard . While the program not functioning like intended can be a reason that a submission fails to meet a standard, what the student includes in their written response can also be the reason. If the student is not being specific about the program purpose, function, algorithms, etc., it is likely that Collegeboard cannot award them the point for being vague. Another reason could be that the submission shows that the student did not thoroughly look at the rubric themselves to make sure that they met all the criteria. Without reading the rubric, one cannot be for certain if they have met a standard, which is why it is always important to review the rubric before getting started on the project. This way, you will not have to start from scratch if you find out that it does not meet the criteria on the rubric. .",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

            "content": "Submission 1 . Reporting Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | The student did not meet this requirement because rather than actually stating the purpose of the program, the student simply describes the functionality of it. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student met the requirement because they provide two code segments: one showing data being stored and the other showing data being accessed. They also specify what is stored in the list. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The student did not meet the requirement because their use of the list does not manage complexity and they give an inaccurate explanation on how the program would be different without lists and how lists are more efficient. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student met the requirement because they show a student-developed procedure and describes the functionality of the procedure. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student met the requirement because the algorithm includes sequencing, selection, and iteration and describes how the algorithm in the procedure works. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The student met the requirement because both calls of the procedure are clearly different, they describe the conditions being tested for each call, and they describe the results of each call. | . Discrepancies Between my scoring and CollegeBoard Scoring . For the most part, I gave the same score to the submission on each category as Collegeboard did; however, there was one instance in which we did not agree with each other’s scoring. For the reporting category Program Purpose and Function, I gave the student the point, as I thought that they included enough detail and that they fulfilled the requirement of knowing what the program does and what problems it solves. However, Collegeboard did not award the point because rather than actually specifying the purpose of the program, they simply describe its functionality, which is not the same thing. I likely made this mistake because I simply thought that describing the functionality of the program could also somehow be used to describe its purpose, but now when I look back at the rubric, it clearly states that the person looking at the code does not want the student to describe the program’s functionality. . For all of the other categories, however, I my scoring matched Collegeboard’s scoring for the same reasons as stated by Collegeboard. . Submission 2 . Reporting Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The student met the requirement because they demonstrate the running of the program, specify the program’s purpose, and describes the functionality of the program. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student met the requirement because they provide two distinct code segments (one showing data being stored, one showing data being accessed) and identifies what is stored in the list. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 1 | The student met the requirement because their program includes a list that accesses and stores the status of a large number of items. They also give an accurate explanation for how the code could not be made without a list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student met the requirement because they include a student-developed procedure and describes its functionality. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student met the requirement because they include a student-developed algorithm and explains how the algorithm in the procedure works so that one could recreate it. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The student met the requirement because they demonstrate two different calls of the program, describes the conditions being tested, and describes the two different results. | . Discrepancies Between my scoring and CollegeBoard Scoring . Similar to the last submission, my scoring matched Collegeboard’s scoring for most of the categories. The only category in which my scoring did not agree with Collegeboard’s scoring was the Managing Complexity row. I did not award the student the point, as I thought that saying in their written response that a list on its own manages complexity would not be enough for them to earn the point; however, this is not the same conclusion Collegeboard came to. Collegeboard awarded the point to the student because of how their list is able to store and access the status of many items, thus making the process of running and executing the program much more efficient. Now when I look at Collegeboard’s commentary, I realize why the student earned the point and understand how their program manages complexity. . What my CPT Program Will Need + Criteria . To recap, below are the six criteria that Collegeboard will be looking for in my Create Performance Task: . Program Purpose/Function | Data Abstraction | Managing Complexity | Procedural Abstraction | Algorithm Implementation | Testing | . In order for me to get a full score on the CPT, my submission needs to meet all six of these criteria. While I do not have any finalized ideas for what I am going to for my CPT (yet), below are a few that I have brainstormed and thought about for quite some time: . Some kind of fun game that can also help the user learn something | Program that allows a user to track their daily activity, water intake, food intake, etc. | Maybe a program that takes a data set and calculates the mean, median, mod, standard deviation, etc. | . Regardless of what I end up doing, my program needs to meet these six criteria . Why a Submission Might Not Meet a Standard . While the program not functioning as it should can be a reason that a submission fails to meet a standard, what the student includes in their written response can also be the reason. If the student is not being specific about the program purpose, function, algorithms, etc., it is likely that Collegeboard cannot award them the point for being vague. Another reason could be that the submission shows that the student did not thoroughly look at the rubric themselves to make sure that they met all the criteria. Without reading the rubric, one cannot be for certain if they have met a standard, which is why it is always important to review the rubric before getting started on the project. This way, you will not have to start from scratch if you find out that it does not meet the criteria on the rubric. .",

            "content": "Algorithm - An algorithm is a set of steps or procedures that are designed to accomplish a certain task. . Application Program Interface (APIs) - Application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for constructing software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact. In addition, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. . Binary - A numeric system of base 2 that only uses combinations of the digits zero and one; this is used in one of the lowest levels of abstraction. Computers operate in binary, as they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones. While a single binary digit can be used to represent True (1) or False (0) in boolean logic, multiple binary digits can be used in conjunction to store large numbers and perform complex functions. Computers translate between binary and what you actually work with such as numbers and text. . Binary Search - A search algorithm that locates the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half; can only be used when the list is sorted. Because of its divide-and-conquer approach, the amount of work required to find an item grows much more slowly with Binary Search than with Sequential Search. . Boolean Function - Any function based on the operations AND, OR, and NOT, and whose elements are from the domain of Boolean algebra. A function whose arguments, as well as the function itself, assume values from a two-element set (usually {0,1}) Central Processing Unit CPU, or processor, is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place. Contains the circuitry necessary to interpret and execute program instructions. . Bits - A binary digit, the smallest increment of data on a computer . Bytes - A group of binary digits or bits (usually eight) operated on as a unit . Characters - A display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol . Strings - Any series of characters that are interpreted literally by a script, ex. “Hello World” . Length - Gets length of string or list with len() function . Concatenation - Joining two strings together . Unsigned Integer - integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don’t have a + or - sign associated with them . Signed Integer - 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range . Nibbles - A nibble is a four consecutive binary digits or half of an 8-bit byte . Computational Artifact - Something created by a human using a computer and can be, but is not limited to, a program, an image, an audio, a video, a presentation, or web page file . Cryptography - The science of coding and decoding messages in order to keep them secure. Coding takes place using a key that ideally is known only by the sender and intended recipient of the message. . Floating Point Numbers - As the name implies, floating point numbers are numbers that contain floating decimal points. Examples include, the numbers 5.5, 0.001, and -2,345.6789. Numbers without decimal places are called integers. Computers recognize real numbers that contain fractions as floating point numbers. . Hexadecimal - Hexadecimal describes a base-16 number system. That is, it describes a numbering system containing 16 sequential numbers as base units (including 0) before adding a new position for the next number. The hexadecimal numbers are 0-9 and then use the letters A-F. Used to represent digital data because it utilizes fewer digits than binary. . Integers - An integer is a whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero. In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some finite subset of the mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. . Iterations - Iteration is the repetition of part of an algorithm until a condition is met or for a specified number of times. This is often called a ‘loop’. Recursive functions repeatedly execute themselves as part of their operation. Upon completing all instructions and resetting to the first one iteration has been completed. . Libraries - In computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources that a program can use often to develop software. Libraries are particularly useful for storing frequently used routines because you do not need to explicitly link them to every program that uses them. The linker automatically looks in libraries for routines that it does not find elsewhere. Resources which may be found in libraries include data, documentation, message templates, pre-written code, classes, or values. . ASCII - Most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet . Unicode - An international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs. . RBG - RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display . Linear/Sequential Search - A process that checks every element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found or all elements have been searched. Can be used in any type of list. Has linear performance. . Lossless Data Compression - With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally in the file remains after the file is uncompressed. All of the information is completely restored. This is generally the technique of choice for text or spreadsheet files, where the loss of words or financial data could pose a problem. PNG is an image format that provides lossless compression. . Lossy Data Compression - Lossy compression reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information, especially redundant information. When the file is uncompressed, only a part of the original information is still there (although the user may not notice it). Lossy compression is generally used for video and sound, where a certain amount of information loss will not be detected by most users. JPEG provides lossy compression. . Metadata - Metadata is data that describes other data. Metadata summarizes basic information about data, which can make finding and working with particular instances of data easier. It provides information concerning an item’s content such as image resolution and size. . Pseudocode - Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do. It may also describe an operating principle. It is expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language intended for humans. The conventions of normal programming continue. Sequencing The execution of each step/action of an algorithm in the precise order in which the statements are given. . Procedural Abstraction - When we write code sections which are generalized by having variable parameters . Procedure - Set(s) of instructions that can take parameters (do not have to have parameters and only have ()) and return values or the function . Parameters - Values inputted into a function for the function to produce a result . Return Values - The value that is returned after a function is run . Simulation - An imitation of a situation or process that can take into account the complexity of the world. . Collatz - The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. . Link to Example . Hailstone numbers - The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture are called Hailstone Numbers . Undecidable problems - An undecidable problem is one that should give a “yes” or “no” answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs. . Unsolvable problems - An unsolvable problem is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution. .",

I noticed how I kept getting the same error involving the key error &quot;Del Norte&quot;, and I tried several times to adjust the naming of Del Norte in the earlier code segment with all of the locations. Despite my efforts, I kept getting the same error. I tried to see if anyone else had a similar issue like this online and tried out what they did to solve it for themselves, but it unfortunately was still not enough to fix the problem. Although I could not get this code segment to work, I still think I was able to learn a lot overall from the lesson for 3.18 and was at least able to show that I did the best I could on this homework assignment. . Update . I was actually able to figure out how to get the code to work. It turns out that the names of the locations in the data set were inconsistent in how they were named, causing the error described above to appear. I corrected the names and made sure that everything was consistent and I was able to get everything working! :) . Grading: .

Some ideas to get your brain running: A simulation that breeds two plants and tells you phenotypes of offspring, an adventure simulation... . For this hack, I chose to write code that allows a user to input two colors and shows them what color they make when mixed. . def mix_colors(color1, color2): # define a dictionary that shows mixtures of two colors and their resulting color color_mixtures = { (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;white&quot;): &quot;pink&quot;, (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;): &quot;purple&quot;, (&quot;black&quot;, &quot;white&quot;): &quot;gray&quot;, (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;): &quot;yellow&quot;, (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;): &quot;orange&quot;, (&quot;magenta&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;): &quot;red&quot; } # this makes it so that the inputs are not case sensitive color1 = color1.lower() color2 = color2.lower() # check if the color pair exists in the dictionary if (color1, color2) in color_mixtures: return color_mixtures[(color1, color2)] # return the resulting color # this makes it so that the order in which the user enters the colors does not matter elif (color2, color1) in color_mixtures: return color_mixtures[(color2, color1)] # return the resulting color else: return &quot;unknown&quot; # if the color pair inputted by the user is not found in the dictionary, return &quot;unknown&quot; # accept user input for the two colors color1 = input(&quot;Enter the first color: &quot;) print(&quot;Color entered: &quot;,color1) color2 = input(&quot;Enter the second color: &quot;) print(&quot;Color entered: &quot;,color2) # mixes the colors and prints the result result = mix_colors(color1, color2) print(&quot;When mixed, {} and {} make {}&quot;.format(color1,color2,result)) . Color entered: red Color entered: white When mixed, red and white make pink . I also made a version of this code in which it randomly selects a color pair from the dictionary and tells us what colors the pair make when mixed: . import random # dictionary that shows results of various color mixtures color_mixtures = { &quot;red, white&quot;: &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;red, blue&quot;: &quot;purple&quot;, &quot;black, white&quot;: &quot;gray&quot;, &quot;red, green&quot;: &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;red, yellow&quot;: &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;magenta, yellow&quot;: &quot;red&quot; } # chooses a random color mixture from the dictionary above color_mixture = random.choice(list(color_mixtures.keys())) # Split the color pair string on the comma character colors = color_mixture.split(&quot;,&quot;) # Join the resulting list of colors with &quot;and&quot; colors_str = &quot; and &quot;.join(colors) # Uses the dictionary above to determine the resulting color when the two colors are mixed resulting_color = color_mixtures[color_mixture] # Prints the two colors and the result when mixed print(&quot;When mixed, {} make {}&quot;.format(colors_str, resulting_color)) . When mixed, black and white make gray .",

            "content": "3.11 Developing Algorithms (Python) . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks. Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs. To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. . Determine the outcome of algorithms . Consider the following algorithm. . def mystery(num, num2): if (num % num2 == 0): print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) mystery(20, 4) . True . What does the algorithm do? Please explain in words. The algorithm essentially prints true if the remainder of the two numbers (%) is equal to 0. Otherwise, if the remainder is not 0, False will be printed. | What if I put in 30 as num and 4 as num2. What would be the output? False because the remainder of 30 and 4 is not equal to 0. 30/4 = 7.5, which means that these two numbers do not go into each other evenly. | Determine the outcome of similar algorithms . What is the output of this algorithm? &quot;It is too hot outside&quot; would be the output of this algorithm because 95 is greater than or equal to 90. . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;I will go outside&quot;) else: print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside . What is the output of this algorithm? it looks similar but the output is different! There will be two things: &quot;It is too hot outside&quot; and &quot;I will go outside&quot; . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;i will go outside&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside i will go outside . Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in). This code segment allows the user to input any temperature, and depending on what it is, the output will be one of the three messages below: . temp = int(input(&quot;Please enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(f&#39;{temp} degrees outside. It is too hot!&#39;) if (temp &gt;= 65 and temp &lt;= 90): print(f&#39;{temp} degrees outside. I will go outside!&#39;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(f&#39;{temp} degrees outside. It is too cold!&#39;) . 72 degrees outside. I will go outside! . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task for 3.11 (Python) . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = 0 for i in range (1, 10, 2): sum = sum + i print(sum) . 25 . Homework 3.11 (Algorithms in Python) . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 . 3.11 (Algorithms in Python) Homework Submission . def collatz(num: int) -&gt; int: # if the number is even and its remainder when divided by 2 is 0, the user&#39;s original input will be divided by 2 if num % 2 == 0: return num // 2 # otherwise, if the input is an odd positive number, that number will be multiplied by 3 and have 1 added to it else: return 3 * num + 1 while True: # prompts for a positive number num = int(input(&#39;Please enter a positive integer: &#39;)) # if the user types in a valid input, the collatz conjecture will come into play beginning from that inputted value if num &gt;= 0: print(&quot;Starting Value: &quot;,num) break # If the user tries to input a negative number, the code will prompt them with this and allow them to try again. else: print(&quot;Invalid input. Please try again and enter a positive integer:&quot;) # the collatz conjecture continues to perform its necessary operations on the numbers until it finally reaches 1 while num != 1: num = collatz(num) print(num) print(&quot;That&#39;s all folks!&quot;) . Starting Value: 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 That&#39;s all folks! . 3.9 Binary Search Introduction . What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . 3.9 Binary Search Introduction Homework . Problem: Given a specific integer N, return the square root of N (R) if N is a perfect square, otherwise, return the square root of N rounded down to the nearest integer . Input: N (Integer) . Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute? Is there some value or rule you can set before applying binary search to narrow the range of possible values? . Run the very last code segment below to load test cases and submission function . from math import sqrt as sq def sqrt(N: int) -&gt; int: low = 0 high = N while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 if mid * mid &lt;= N: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return low - 1 . from math import sqrt as sq # these are all of the numbers that will be tested on to see if each one passes the test test_cases = [0,1,4,85248289,22297284,18939904,91107025,69122596,9721924,37810201,1893294144,8722812816,644398225] # these are the expected values for the square root of each number answers = [int(sq(x)) for x in test_cases] def checkValid(): for i in range(len(test_cases)): # if the number from test_cases returns the expected value from the answers, it will print that the check number [number] has passed if sqrt(test_cases[i]) == answers[i]: print(&quot;Check number {} passed&quot;.format(i+1)) # if the number from test_cases does not return the expected value from the answers list, it will print that the check number [number] has failed else: print(&quot;Check number {} failed&quot;.format(i+1)) # calls the checkValid() function checkValid() .

As much as I would have liked to try the challenge of making an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address, my JavaScript kernel has continued to not be working properly. I have tried several solutions that I found online to fix the problem, but no matter what I have tried, it still does not work. Although my kernel does not work, here is how I would have tried to go about doing this challenge (note: no output is shown since the kernel doesn&#39;t work) . Update: My JavaScript Kernel has just started working, but even when I run the code, I still get that there is a syntax error in how I declared the function &quot;computeNetworkAddress&quot;. I have tried looking up solutions to this problem online and have tried them, but I still get the same error no matter what. . function computeNetworkAddress(ipAddress, subnetMask) { // Convert the IP address and subnet mask to binary var binaryIpAddress = convertToBinary(ipAddress); var binarySubnetMask = convertToBinary(subnetMask); // Perform a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask var networkAddressBinary = binaryIpAddress &amp; binarySubnetMask; // Convert the result back to decimal var networkAddress = convertToDecimal(networkAddressBinary); // Return the network address return networkAddress; } function convertToBinary(address) { // Split the address into its octets var octets = address.split(&quot;.&quot;); // Convert each octet to binary var binaryOctets = octets.map(function(octet) { return parseInt(octet).toString(2); }); // Concatenate the binary octets into a single binary string return binaryOctets.join(&quot;&quot;); } function convertToDecimal(binary) { // Split the binary string into octets var binaryOctets = binary.match(/.{1,8}/g); // Convert each binary octet to decimal var octets = binaryOctets.map(function(binaryOctet) { return parseInt(binaryOctet, 2); }); // Concatenate the octets into a single decimal string return octets.join(&quot;.&quot;); } var ipAddress = &quot;192.168.0.1&quot;; var subnetMask = &quot;255.255.255.0&quot;; var networkAddress = computeNetworkAddress(ipAddress, subnetMask); console.log(networkAddress); // Output: &quot;192.168.0.0&quot; .

Searching when it comes to computer programs and applications involves locating and retrieving a data value/and or its index Searching algorithms can be done in intervals or sequentially | . | Sequential Search - checks every value of the given array Cannot keep up with increasing input sizes, as the longer the array, the more time that it will take for the search to check | In other words, as the input lists gets larger, the runtime of the program increases &quot;linearly&quot; as well | . | Binary Search - a more efficient way to check through a sorted list to find a specific value Involves checking the medium or middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is higher or lower than the middle value | If the list is not sorted or in a proper order, the binary search algorithm cannot work anymore | The maximum number of cycles in a binary search is equivalent to the log base 2 of the closest, next power of 2, to the length of the list | When it comes to execution time, using the binary search method will overall take less time than using the sequential search method and is therefore more efficient and worthy of one&#39;s time | . | . 3.11 Algorithms (Can be Applied to both Python &amp; JavaScript) Notes . Algorithms are specific steps designed to accomplish a certain task | In developing algorithms, it is crucial to understand what the question is asking | Example: if one wanted to sum up the first five integers, they would probably think about how... The sum of the first integer is 1 | Increase that integer by 1 before adding 2 to the existing sum. At this point, the new sum is 3 | This process would be repeated until 5 is added to the sum. To recap, this thought process would look something like this for humans: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 | . | The resulting sum of the first five integers is 15. | . | . Here is what this thought process would look like in Python: . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 .",

Variables are abstractions within programs which represent a value | Values can be individual data points or a list/collection that contains many data values | Types of data: numbers, Booleans (T/F), lists, and strings | . Variables and Assignments (Python) . To define a variable, simply type in the variable name and use the equal sign to set it equal to its value | Variable can be defined using numbers, string, list, or boolean (strings must have quotations around it and lists must be surrounded by square brackets) | Dictionaries | Interchanging variables | Floats | Even Function | . Variables and Assignments (JavaScript) . One way to assign a variable is doing var (variable name) = value; | Another way to assign a variable is using const (variable name) = value; | . Unit 3.2 Data Abstraction . Key points: . Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation | Data abstraction manages complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific elements of the representation | Data Abstraction makes it easier to implement, develop, and maintain code | The use of lists allows for multiple related values to be treated as a single value | . Unit 3.3 Expressions . the symbol for exponent is “**” | the symbol for addition is “+” | the symbol for subtraction is “-“ | the symbol for multiplication is “*” | the symbol for division is “/” | the symbol for modulus is “%” | an algorithm is a sequence of steps that are made to perform a specific task repeatedly. | . Unit 3.4 Strings . Pseudo Code . Pseudo code is writing out a program in plain language with keywords that are used to refer to common coding concepts | Does not use actual code | Can be used to explain a concept about coding to someone who has no experience with | Begins at index 1 | . Length . The length of a string in coding is essentially the number of coding units or characters present in a string. For example, the length of the string “hello” would be 5. | . Concatenation . Concatenation is basically joining two strings together to form one string. For example, one could concatenate the strings “hello” and “world” in order to make a single string that says “hello world” | . Substring . A substring is a subset or a part of another string. For example, “hello” would be considered a substring in the string “hello world”. | . 3.1-3.4 Takeaways . Overall, I felt that I was able to learn a lot from other students teaching us these concepts (data abstraction, assignments, etc.). I also believe that I will find these notes very useful for when I study for the AP Exam as well as when I work on my Create Performance Task. .",

Lists are collections of data | Can be used to store unlimited amounts of data | Lists are a good way to organize and collect data in a program, as they allow a set of potentially very different items to be found within one object | Using functions like append(), pop(), and insert(), you can add new things to a list or remove them. | .

Overview and Notes: 3.8 - Iteration . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a function | Allowing a function to repeat on its own based on various conditions can vastly optimize a program | Iteration is most often done with loops, typically in combination with lists and/or dictionaries. | There are multiple types of loops, and while most types can, in some way, do the same thing as other types, some things are simpler to do with certain loops than others. | Iteration and loops go together like bread and butter. | .

Below are a list of numbers converted from binary into decimal AND less than 100 [73, 55] . What Went Wrong (And What I Tried To Do) . I was not sure how to make the binary to decimal converter, as even after one person talked about how they went about, I still was confused about how to implement what they said into my code | I tried to use a for loop and use the &quot;int&quot; type in order to convert every binary value in the list to a decimal value, but when I ran the code, nothing showed up in the output (no error messages) | I tried using for &quot;bin&quot; in binarylist, but I still was not getting anything in the output | I hope that eventually, all of the concepts that we learned in this lesson will become clear to me and that I will be able to go back to this code and improve myself | . Updates as of 12/6/22 . I finally figured out how to write out the code for the binary to decimal program | Things that I realized: In order to convert the binary to decimal, I had to make sure that I used &quot;return&quot; along with the int type in order to get the binary value as its decimal | I had to make a for loop that converted every element that was in the list into binary, which relates back to using &quot;return&quot; in order to get its decimal value | Once I figured out how to do that, I could use an if statement such that the program only printed out binary values who decimals came out to be less than 100, which in this case was 73 and 55 | . | .",

            "title": "Tri 1 Final Blog/Review",
            "content": "Overview . This blog shows some of the questions that I either got wrong or forced me to think about the answer for a little while before getting it right. It also goes into detail on questions I got wrong and what I can do better to not make that same mistake on a question like that for the future. . My Score . The final exam was 50 questions for a grand total of 50 points. I earned a score of 48/50 (96%), as shown below: My overall score indicates that I showed a great understanding of what we have been learning through Collegeboard. The questions that I got wrong were questions 35 and 48. . Questions/Test Corrections . Question 35 (wrong) . One of the questions to review is question 35 shown below: I ended up getting this question wrong, as even though I chose one of the two correct answers, the second one that I chose was incorrect, so I did not get the point. I made a mistake in thinking that because the maxPS &lt;- 50 was below and outside the if statement that it also could be interpreted as an else statement. However, the code below the if statement really meant that regardless of time, the max score is 50. I will definitely make sure that I understand this kind of question better by reading the code carefully and considering what each line of code really means. . Question 48 (wrong) . The next question to review was question 48 shown below: . This was another question that I got wrong, as I completely forgot that although y initially had a value of 50, it was later on changed to 75 in the fifth statement, which made me believe that the option x, y, and z was correct. The next time I see a question like this, I will make sure to read the statements carefully and to keep track of what is being changed and what is being kept constant, as doing so will lead me towards the right answer. . Question 19 (correct) . The next question to review is question 19, shown below: . I actually got this question right, with the correct answer being option C, “An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15.” Even though I got this question right, it did take me few minutes to figure out the answer, as I had to quickly refresh my memory on how binary numbers worked. Now that I know how binary numbers are expressed in their decimal forms, I am much more confident about answering questions like these for the future. . Question 22 (correct) . The next question to review is question 22, shown below: . I also got this question right, with the correct answer being option C, 9. Similar to Question 19, it took me a minute or two to confidently select the answer, as I needed to make sure that I had a full understanding of how binary numbers are structured. With more practice on questions like these, I will definitely have a better time answering these kinds of questions on any future multiple choice exams. . Question 34 (correct) . The next question to review is question 34, shown below: . I chose the correct answer for this question, which was option B shown above. Although I selected the right answer, it took me a few minutes to confidently choose my answer, as I checked multiple times to ensure that I was keeping track of any lists that were changing/any lists that were remaining constant. For these kinds of questions, I should not be spending too much time on them, as there may be other questions that follow it that will take longer, thus giving me not as much time to look through them before answering. . Question 41 (correct) . The last question to review is question 41, shown below: . I chose the correct answer for this question as well, which was option B, 20. Similar to Question 34, I took time to answer this question because I checked to make sure that I was correctly keeping track of any variables that were changing or staying the same throughout the code segment. For these kinds of questions, it may be easier if instead of going through what happens in my head, I should simply write it down on any scratch paper I have on me, as I will clearly be able to see what is happening and will know faster which answer of the four is correct. . Reflection/Final Thoughts . Overall, I am very happy with the score that I earned, as it tells me that I have a great understanding of what we have studied in this class and shows me that I can answer multiple choice questions like these really well. The questions I got wrong were also a learning experience for me, as it made me realize how I can approach those kinds of questions in the future to ensure that I do not make those same mistakes again. Beyond the MCQ final, I am proud of the work that I have done for trimester 1, as I had a lot of great moments and experiences in the class yet also many memories of making mistakes and getting frustrated with WSL and AWS not working :). I am very much looking forward to Trimesters 2 and 3 of CSP and seeing how much my skills improve in the fascinating field of computer science. .",

            "content": "Summary of the Event (Presenting Our Project) . Night at the Museum (N@TM) was on November 3, 2022. There were four time slots for the different classes, and we (period 4 Mortensen) had to be at the event to present our work from 6:00pm-6:30pm. Me and another teammate decided to bring our laptops to the event so that we could show curious people and the teacher our final project. Mr. Mortensen said that we needed to bring someone with us to the event, so I decided to bring my older brother with me so that he too could see our work. All of us had the opportunity to present to guests who attended the event, and the room was very crowded with teams from both classes having their laptops out. After the teacher saw our project functioning the way it was supposed to and showing our work to everybody, we all left the room to go and look at work from other electives. . Projects from Other Classes . After our time to present ended, we all went around to other electives to check out their work, such as 3D Animation, Ceramics, AP Studio Art, and many more. I was fascinated by what I was seeing and was amazed at how talented students around my age can be with their art work. I could very much see a lot of effort and dedication was put into the pieces that I saw, and it overall made me feel inspired to start approaching any art-related activites with a positive mindset. . Here are pictures of some of the artwork that I took at N@TM! I hope you like them as much as I did! :) . .",

The purpose of this program is to allow the user to type in any events or activittes that they would like to do for the day so that the computer can complie that list into a coherent daily agenda. This program is also intended to encourage organization, for it stores the list of activites into a day on the calendar. . Row 2: Data Abstraction . What the user wants to do for the day will all be stored in a dictionary or list, which is what brings the data abstraction aspect into the project. . Row 3: Managing Complexity . Using lists and dictionaries will manage the complexity because this way, there will not be any need to create a variable for every single activity that a user wants to do. . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . We will make a segment of a program in which the program can separate the activities into certain categories (sports, entertainment, etc.). This way, the output (daily agenda) that the user receives will be coherent and well-organized. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . We will be using sequencing, selecting, and iterating in order to make the program compile the daily agenda. . Row 6: Testing . This program will definitely be tested multiple times in order to both ensure it is properly functioning and also to enhance the understanding of our own program. .",

Many types of errors | You cannot write a program without errors | Four types Logic Errors | Syntax Errors | Runtime Errors | Overflow Errors | . | Logic errors: A problem by the programmer specifically | Nothing with the internals, but rather a programming skill issue | . | Syntax error Programmer does something that doesn’t line up with the rules of the language | Syntax such as {}, (), ;, etc. | . | Runtime error: When the program fails in the midst of a program | May only occur at certain inputs (letters when you intend numbers, etc.) | . | Overflow errors: When the program maxes out the amount of memory allocation to a certain variable | i.e ints vs floats vs doubles. | . | . Daily Video 1 Takeways . For errors in an algorithm or program: Identify the error | . | A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that cause it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly | A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed | A run-time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Programming languages define their own runtime | An overflow error is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values | . 1.4: Daily Video 2 . When syntax error: Often you are directed to the area of the error | It could be at the line, the line above, the line under, etc. | Fix the error that is just a typo | . | When Logic errors: use test cases | See the output and certain values | Some IDEs have certain debuggers to assist in helping logic stuff | . | . Daily Video 2 Takeways . For errors in an algorithm or program: Correct the error | . | The following are effect ways to find and correct errors: test cases | hand tracing | visualizations | debuggers | adding extra output statement(s) | . | . 1.4: Daily Video 3 . Often you need many testing “schemes” to help with testing | We start testing at the start of development Start thinking | Start planning specifications | Plan how to test (influenced by specifications) | . | After testing programmers revise sections of their code that didn’t work | You keep testing, and then get users to test, and then release | And even after, you will get errors, leading to certain maintainence patches | . Daily Video 3 Takeways . Identify inputs and corresponding expected outputs or behaviors that can be used to check the correctness of an algorithm or program | In the development process, testing uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes. Programmers use the results from testing to revise their algorithms or programs | Defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes that are at or just beyond the extremes of input data | Program requirements are needed to identify appropriate defined inputs for testing | . Personal Takeways . After watching all of the daily videos, I now realize how important testing is and how it can be applied to identifying and correcting errors in an algorithm or program. With this in mind, I will apply these important points to the final project that we will have to produce as a team . MCQ Results . . I earned a 100% on this quiz, which demonstrates that I have a great understanding of identifying and correcting errors in a program or algorithm. .",

            "content": "For this week&#39;s hacks, we were challenged to identify and correct errors on a code segment that allows a user to order items from a menu. Below is the code with errors: . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(total) . Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 0 . The problem with the above code is that it prompts the user to order something only one time. Also, as you can see, even if a user orders something, the total cost still remains at 0. Below is the code that has all of these errors corrected: . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 # welcomes the user shows them the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Hello!

Hello! Welcome to our Python restaurant! What would you like? Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 $ 3.99 $ 5.98 $ 6.97 Have a nice day! .

            "content": "1.3: Daily Video 1 . How is a program developed? . It all starts with an idea. . Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | At times, the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) | . Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect . Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | . After initial investigation and reflection… . Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on investigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that… describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The program specifications outline all of the requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): a gradual process is frequently used so that developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program | . | . Testing, testing, and more testing! . Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . Daily Video 1 Personal Takeaways . After watching the first daily video of 1.3, I now realize that if I want to have my idea for the final project behave like it is supposed to that numerous trials of the program will have to be run. This way, we can all see what parts of the program should be kept as is and which parts need to be modified to ensure optimal user experience. . 1.3: Daily Video 2 . How is a program developed? . Program development is seldom a solo endeavor . Typically, programs are developed by teams of people | Individuals/teams work on different functional components | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work | Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project | . While documentation is an important place to give credit… . Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit | This is an important part of the development of the program | When developers find a bug/error in a program, they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem | This may be most useful after a program is completed, and users find additional bugs | . Many times developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more that are written by others. . These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited | Similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article | Any code segments, procedures, or algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author | The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used | This portion of the documentation may resemble a bibliography or a works cited pages in a research paper | . Daily Video 2 Personal Takeways . I now know that any time I use code segments or algorithms, whether they are from my teammates or outside sources, I should always in some way give credit to the original author of that part of the program. This is because any code segments, procedures, or algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. . 1.3: Daily Video 3 . How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to… . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe… functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of proceess | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throughout can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | programmers’ response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . Commenting allows programmers to write text within the prgoram | This text does not affect the program | Comments are for programmers to read | This is a form of documentation and can be very usefil when programmers collaborate or work individually | . Examples of comments . Text Languages: . Python Uses the “#” symbol followed by the comment | . | Java Uses the “//” symbol” | /* */ used for multiple line comments | /** */ used for multiple line documentation comments | . | Javascript, C/C++, or Swift similar to Java | XML/HTML ”&lt;&gt;” used for single or multi line comments | . | Applescript/Pascal ”(Comments)” used for single or multi line | . | . Daily Video 3 Personal Takeways . After watching this video, I now understand why it is important to include comments in code, as it allows one to understand what something does and how it was developed. .

Social Media Applications Allows users to connect from a distance and archive their activites | . | E-commerce Allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home | . | Digital Assistant Device Allows users to control their devices hands-free making them safer while driving or more convenient when trying to multitask | . | . Daily Video 1: Takeaways . The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interest through creative expression | An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovations provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation | . 1.2: Daily Video 2 . Identifying Inputs to Programs . Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms: . tactile (touch) | audio | visual | text (including numerical values) | . Examples: . Smart phone/tablet (texting, entering password, etc.) | Laptop computer (keyboard, mouse, etc.) | Gaming console (send input through buttons) | . How do programs receive input? . Most programs are written in an event driven environment. . “Events” are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program | . Types of events a user can trigger: . mouse clicks | screen taps/swipes (force touch) | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output. Outputs produced by a device can include: . visual | audio | tactile (touch/feel) | text | . Example of output that devices supply: . Smart phone/tablet (things that appear on screen based on what you have pressed/swiped) | Laptop computer (displays texts after using keyboard) | Gaming console (remote vibrations) | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . An action triggers an event: . Action may be activated by the user or another program/device | . The program “jumps” to the code segment according to the event: . The code segment is ran | Output is triggered by the code segment/additional events that are triggered | . The program does not necessarily execute “in order”: . Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered | . Daily Video 2: Takeaways . Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program | Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution | Inputs USUALLY affect the output produced by a program | Program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state | . 1.2: Daily Video 3 . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements: . A statement is a single command | A group of statements is called a code segment | A program is often referred to as “software” | Code segments are executed by rules of the coding language | . What does the program shown in the video do? - written to find the minimum value in a list . The code segment should work for a variety of different lists, such as numbers that are out of order, negative numbers, large numbers, and decimals | . Description . Simply state what the segment does this way, someone else can use the segment in a larger program | . | Include how it does what it does this way, someone could expand upon the code segment | . | . Daily Video 3: Takeaways . A program is a collection of program statements that performs a task when run by a computer | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program | A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations | . Personal Takeways . After watching all three videos, I feel that I truly understand why knowing the purpose and function of a program is essential. Knowing exactly what your program is intended to do could allow someone who is reading it to use it in a larger program or even expand upon it. Overall, having knowledge about this big idea will definitely be helpful and I will apply this idea to anything that I do in this class. . Proof of Completon of Quesitons .",

Includes practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions, and sprints | Brings out all the good charactristics in group development | The 12 Principles . Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. | Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage. | Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. | Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. | Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. | The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. | Working software is the primary measure of progress!!! | Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. | Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. | Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential. | The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. | At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. | Key Vocab . Sprint - period of time that a team uses to plan and execute work. This includes planning, research, development, deployment, and test. . Creativity - in the context of education and a workplace, creativity presents itself as how you approach tasks and look for solutions to problems. . Critical thinking - being able to look at things more deeply and understand things such as ways to improve something. . Communication - includes verbal (how you address an audience in terms they can understand), listening (learning and understanding), writing, and technological communication skills. . Researching - can include analyzing information, brainstorming solutions, extracting information from data, gathering information, setting goals, and solving problems. .",

The video I linked in my Week 4 Review Ticket demonstrates the functionality of both of my local servers and me making changes to each one to show that they both work like they are supposed to. However, there are a few things that I would like to add on to the video and clarify: . Local IP Address/Port . For my Python Flask Web Server, the server address is “http://127.0.0.1:5000/”. Here is what each part of the link means: . The “127.0.0.1” portion of the link represents the jekyll server number that the Python server is running on | The “5000” at the end of the link represents the local host, or machine that is running the server live | . For the local Fastpages server, the server address is “http://0.0.0.0:4000/emaad-fastpages/”. Here is the link broken down into its parts: . Similar to the Python web server, the “0.0.0.0” represents the jekyll server number that is running the Fastpages server locally | The “4000” is the local host/machine/computer running the server | At the very end of the link is “emaad-fastpages”, which is simply the name of my Github repository for Fastpages. | . Collaboration . In order to show that we collaborated as a team, one of us (credits to Edwin Abraham) created a group repository for our local python server. Near the end of the video, I show all of the actions and commits from the group repository that we all pushed onto Github. We all communicated with each other via Slack and kept each other up on where each of us were in completing the hacks for this week. I definitely feel that we all learned something from watching those Collegeboard videos about collaboration, as we really tried taking into account different perspectives and expressing those differing points of view into our repository. . I hope that this blog helped you learn something about this week’s hacks and extended your knowledge beyond what my video showed! .",

I also had a difficult time organizing my code so that it was more readable, as I completely forgot about dividing my code into sections until after I finished the program. Overall, while I did have a few issues in desigining this program, I still managed to successfully produce a quiz that can help a user learn something new about space. . Relating My Quiz to the Create Performance Task Rubric . While my quiz does follow some of the requirements of the CPT, it doesn’t necessarily meet all of them. However, if I can refine this quiz, I can definitely make it so that it meets all requirements for the CPT. Below are some connections to each of the components of the Create Performance Task Rubric: . Program Purpose and Function . Purpose: The purpose of the function is to test a user’s knowledge on specific facts about space and NASA. In addition, the quiz is also intended to teach the user something that they may not have known about before taking the quiz. | Functionality: When the user clicks the start button to begin the quiz, they will be shown one question at a time, with a total of four questions in the entire quiz. Each question is a different type: clicking on an image to choose an answer, clicking on a radio button, typing something into a text box, and clicking on a button. If the user gets a question correct, they will have a screen popping up informing them that they answered correctly and will have a point added to their score (predefined as a variable equal to 0). If the user gets a question wrong, they will have a screen that says they chose the wrong answer and will have no points taken away from or added to their score. At the end, the user will have their final score displayed. | Input/Output: For this quiz, the input is the answer the user clicks on/types in. The output is if they answered correctly or not, which is shown by the screen that displays after they have answered the question. | . Data Abstraction . All of the points that a user earned from the quiz is stored in a variable called score, and while I did not include any lists, I definitely could refine my quiz more by incorporating dictionaries and lists. . Managing Complexity . One way that my quiz could manage complexity is to store all of the possible answers for each question into their own functions, and add iterations that classify an answer as right or wrong. This way, I won’t have to repeat the same lines of code over and over again. . Procedural Abstraction . I can make my code so that depending on what the user has inputted, a specific part of the code will be ran. . Algorithm Implementation . My quiz uses sequencing, selecting, and iterating in order to form an algorithm involving the quiz that someone else could use and incorporate into their own quiz or game. . Testing . I tested this quiz multiple times, both in the process of creating the quiz and even after I fully programmed it. For the first call, I made it so that the user got a specific question wrong and got the other two correct, therefore displaying a final score of 2 out of 3. For the second call, I made it so that the user got two questions wrong and one correct, giving a final score of 1 out of 3. | . Improvements . Find a more efficient way of writing the code rather than having the same lines of code be repeated multiple times | Add more segments to the code so that different inputs will result in a completely different part of the code being run | Make a function that responds accordingly to a user’s input to a question. This way, there will not be any need to have to write the same lines of code for every incorrect or correct answer | .",

            "content": "Create Performance Task Idea . I want to make a program in which a user can input their daily agenda. This will include what work they want to do for the day, specific times of the day for those activities, and the duration of each item in the daily agenda. . My Idea and the CPT Rubric . Here is how I plan for my program to meet each component of the rubric: . Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program will be to encourage organization, as the user will input a list of activities they want to do for the day. Once the user has entered their specific things to do, the program will then compile what they have included into an organized, cohesive daily agenda. The program will also include specific details about how the user should go about doing a certain activity. . Row 2: Data Abstraction . What the user wants to do for the day will all be stored in a dictionary or list, which is what data abstraction essentially is. . Row 3: Managing Complexity . Using lists and dictionaries will manage the complexity because this way, there will not be any need to create a variable for every single activity that a user wants to do. . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . I will make a segment of a program in which the program can separate the activities into certain categories (sports, entertainment, etc.). This way, the output (daily agenda) that the user receives will be coherent and well-organized. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . I will be using sequencing, selecting, and iterating in order to make the program compile the daily agenda. . Row 6: Testing . This program will definitely be tested multiple times in order to both ensure it is properly functioning and also to enhance the understanding of my own program. . What I Know vs. What I Need to Know . While I have a good idea about what I could do for the program purpose and function, data abstraction, and testing part of the project, I do think that I need to learn a little bit more about managing complexity, procedural abstraction, and algorithm implementation. Knowing what each of these components are will be critical in making sure that my creation meets all of the College Board criteria. .",

List and Dictionary Purpose . Lists and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected, it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern . Dictionary is used to define data patterns. . Iteration is often used to process through lists. . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and hobbies. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and hobbies InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Emaad&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mir&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;January 12&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;emaadidrismir@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;FavoriteFoods&quot;: [&quot;French Fries, Ice Cream, Bananas, Pizza&quot;], &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Playing Squash&quot;, &quot;Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Hiking&quot;, &quot;Cooking&quot;, &quot;Playing Basketball&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Edwin&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Abraham&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 7&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;edwinab0007@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;FavoriteFoods&quot;: [&quot;Burgers, Pizza, Brownies, Watermelon&quot;], &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Biking&quot;,&quot;Hiking&quot;, &quot;Playing Video Games&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. . Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. . Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. . def print_data(person): # defines the data being printed print(&quot;Name:&quot;, person[&quot;FirstName&quot;], person[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # Tells the computer to print certain things from the dictionary print(&quot;Birthday:&quot;, person[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot;Email:&quot;, person[&quot;Email&quot;]) print(&quot;FavoriteFoods:&quot;, &quot;, &quot;.join(person[&quot;FavoriteFoods&quot;])) print(&quot;Hobbies:&quot;, &quot;, &quot;.join(person[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) print() print_data(InfoDb[0]) # Prints the data of the first person (Emaad Mir) .

While Loops . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() . def while_loop(): # i starts at 0 i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): # while i is less than the length of the dictionary (2), keep printing the people&#39;s data print_data(InfoDb[i]) i = i + 1 def while_loop_reverse(): # this does the same thing as described above, except it prints in reverse order i = len(InfoDb) - 1 while i &gt;= 0: print_data(InfoDb[i]) i = i -1 print(&quot;REGULAR WHILE LOOP n&quot;) # labels the regular and reversed version of the list of people and their info while_loop() print(&quot;REVERSED WHILE LOOP n&quot;) while_loop_reverse() .

Recursive Loops . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; . the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing . ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends . def recursive(index): # the recursive loop will keep calling itself until it is greater than or equal to the length of the dictionary if index &gt;= len(InfoDb): return # this is where the code will end print_data(InfoDb[index]) # prints the data and keeps printing until it has reached the length of the dictionary return recursive(index + 1) print(&quot;RECURSIVE INDEX OUTPUT n&quot;) recursive(0) # the computer will begin printing person 0&#39;s data and keep calling itself until there are no more people left .

Adding Records to a Dictionary With User Input . You can also have a user input something so that they can add it to the dictionary. For example, the function below shows a user inputting a student&#39;s full name and their grade level, which, once printed, will display what the details of that student. . grade_level = {} for i in range(1): student_name = input(&quot;Enter the student&#39;s full name &quot;) student_grade = input(&quot;Enter the student&#39;s grade level&quot;) grade_level[student_name] = student_grade print(grade_level) . {&#39;Emaad Mir&#39;: &#39;10th&#39;} . Quiz that Stores Dictionaries . Last week, we were all assigned to create a Python quiz. This week, we also need to make a quiz, but it needs to store dictionaries. Below is a demonstration of how that works: . import getpass, sys def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question:&quot; +prompt) msg = input(&quot;Question:&quot; +prompt) print(&quot;Answer:&quot; +msg) ## defines the format of how the question will be asked def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) return msg qa_list = [] # Shows the list of questions and answers qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What syntax allows you to format and pass variables in html?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;liquid&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What is the instructions for what you want a computer to do called?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;input&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What is the name of the theme that your webpage has by default?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;minima&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;_______ involves calling itself repeatedly in order to achieve looping&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;recursion&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;Lists and ________ are used to collect information&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;dictionaries&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What is the name of the file that the style directory is stored in (just the name, don&#39;t need the type of file)?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;sass&quot; }) questions = len(qa_list) # number of questions equals the length of the list of questions and answers score = 0 # this is the score the user will begin with print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) # user will be prompted with this message before taking the quiz print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) response = question_with_response(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) if response == &quot;yes&quot;: # if user types in yes, the quiz will commence print(&quot;You said yes, so let&#39;s get started!&quot;) for q in qa_list: print(q[&quot;Question&quot;]) response = input(q[&quot;Question&quot;]) if response == q[&quot;Answer&quot;]: print(response + &quot; is correct! Great job!&quot;) # if the answer the user types in matches what is on the list, the user will get a point added to score score = score + 1 else: # if the user types something that doesn&#39;t match what&#39;s on the list, the user won&#39;t get a point print(response + &quot; is incorrect! Sorry!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot;, you scored &quot; + str(score) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions) + &quot;, which is &quot; + str((score / questions) * 100) + &quot;%&quot;) else: print(&quot;Maybe another time!&quot;) # if the user responds with no to the first prompt, the user will have this message and the code will end . Hello, root running /bin/python3 You will be asked 6 questions. Question: Are you ready to take a test? You said yes, so let&#39;s get started! What syntax allows you to format and pass variables in html? liquid is correct! Great job! What is the instructions for what you want a computer to do called? input is correct! Great job! What is the name of the theme that your webpage has by default? minima is correct! Great job! _______ involves calling itself repeatedly in order to achieve looping recursion is correct! Great job! Lists and ________ are used to collect information dictionaries is correct! Great job!

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Emaad&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mir&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;January 12&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;emaadidrismir@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;fav_color&quot;: &quot;Blue&quot;, }) print(InfoDb) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) print() print() # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;fav_color:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;fav_color&quot;]) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints...

            "content": "Paper Chromatography Lab . By: Emaad Mir, Bryan Wang, Steven Zhu, Anay Sabhnani . Period 1 . Materials: Expo Marker, Felt Pen, Sharpie, Crayola, paper slip, mystery sample, 70% Isopropyl alcohol, beaker . Procedure: . Place four dots, one for each marker, in a row near the bottom of the paper slip. . | Fill a beaker with 10 mL of isopropyl . | Dip the bottom of the paper slip into the beaker of isopropyl alcohol and let it sit for 10 minutes . | Measure Rf values for each color per ink dot . | . The Science Behind Paper Chromatography: . Paper is made up of cellulose, which contains the chemical compound OH, which is polar. Due to the nature of the structure and the polarity of OH, cellulose is polar . | The mobile phase, or the solvent of 70% isopropyl alcohol (nonpolar), moves up the paper through capillary action. In doing so, it also carries soluble compounds along with it. . | After the mobile phase has moved up as far as it can go, the different ink dots will have moved up as well, each a different distance. . | This is because of the polarity of the ink dots. Since the mobile phase is nonpolar and the stationary phase is polar, the ink dots have moved up different lengths because of their differing polarities. . | A dot that has moved up very close to the solvent front, with the nonpolar mobile phase, would be very nonpolar, as it had little to no attraction to the polar stationary phase and was soluble in the mobile phase because like dissolves like, and was carried up with the mobile phase very easily. . | A dot that has not moved up very much at all would be more polar, as it had a stronger attraction to the polar stationary phase than the nonpolar mobile phase. . | Because of separation by polarity, we can use paper chromatography and the unique polarity of each ink type to find the ransom note’s ink. . | . CER: Who Was The Thief? . C: The marker used by the thief was the expo marker. . E: . Marker Rf Values (respective to colors) Colors . Expo | 0.648, 0.755, and 0.971 | Yellow, Pink, and Blue | . Sharpie | 0.516 and 0.628 | Gray and Purple | . Crayola | 0.720 and 0.988 | Pink and Blue | . Felt | 0.510, 0.779, and 0.991 | Green, Pink, and Blue | . Mystery Sample | 0.553, 0.723, and 0.940 | Yellow, Pink, and Blue | . R: Through qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing each marker’s colors and values, the marker that the thief used can be determined. In terms of qualitative data, it can be observed that the mystery marker is made up of three different compounds that are yellow, blue, and pink. The expo marker is also made up of yellow, pink, and blue compounds, making it the best match for what the thief used because the colors match. The sharpie is made of gray and purple compounds, meaning that it is not a match. The Crayola marker is only made with pink and blue compounds, so it is also unlikely that the thief used the Crayola marker. The felt tip is made up of blue, green, and pink compounds, so it is not a match. In terms of quantitative data, the retention factors of the compounds from the mystery sample were 0.553, 0.723, and 0.940, while the retention factors for the Expo marker were 0.648, 0.755, and 0.971, making the Expo marker’s values closest to that of the mystery’s. The sharpie and Crayola can be ruled out because they lack third Rf values. The felt spot’s Rf values are also somewhat close to the Mystery sample’s, but as proven in the qualitative analysis, it cannot be the pen used by the thief. Because the Expo marker had the greatest quantitative and qualitative similarities with the mystery marker, it can be concluded that the thief used the Expo marker in writing the ransom note. .",
