            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. . import random # variable of type string name = &quot;Emaad Mir&quot; print(&quot;Name:&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 15 print(&quot;Age:&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float grade = 105.9 print(&quot;Grade:&quot;, grade, type(grade)) # another variable of type string fav_song = &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; print(&quot;Favorite Song:&quot;, fav_song, type(fav_song)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;Html&quot;, &quot;CSS&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;R&quot;] random_lang = random.choice(langs) print(&quot;Random Language:&quot;, random_lang) games = [&quot;Super Mario&quot;, &quot;Kirby&quot;, &quot;Wii Sports Resort&quot;, &quot;Subway Surfer&quot;] random_game = random.choice(games) print(&quot;Random Game:&quot;, random_game) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;Name&quot;: name, &quot;Age&quot;: age, &quot;Grade&quot;: grade, &quot;Languages&quot;: langs, &quot;Favorite Song&quot;: fav_song } # prints what is in the person dictionary without brackets print(*[str(k) + &#39;:&#39; + str(v) for k,v in person.items()]) # LISTS THE FOOD IN REVERSE ORDER foods = [&quot;Bread&quot;, &quot;Pizza&quot;, &quot;Burgers&quot;, &quot;Chocolate Cake&quot;, &quot;Salad&quot;, &quot;Fried Rice&quot;, &quot;Noodles&quot;] foods.reverse() print(&#39; nReversed List:&#39;), print(&#39;, &#39;.join(foods)) # LISTS THE FOOD IN A RANDOM ORDER random.shuffle(foods) print(&#39; nRandom Order:&#39;), print(&#39;, &#39;.join(foods)) .

List and Dictionary Purpose . Lists and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected, it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern . Dictionary is used to define data patterns. . Iteration is often used to process through lists. . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and hobbies. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and hobbies InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Emaad&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mir&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;January 12&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;emaadidrismir@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;FavoriteFoods&quot;: [&quot;French Fries, Ice Cream, Bananas, Pizza&quot;], &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Playing Squash&quot;, &quot;Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Hiking&quot;, &quot;Cooking&quot;, &quot;Playing Basketball&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Edwin&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Abraham&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 7&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;edwinab0007@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;FavoriteFoods&quot;: [&quot;Burgers, Pizza, Brownies, Watermelon&quot;], &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Biking&quot;,&quot;Hiking&quot;, &quot;Playing Video Games&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. . Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. . Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. . def print_data(person): # defines the data being printed print(&quot;Name:&quot;, person[&quot;FirstName&quot;], person[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # Tells the computer to print certain things from the dictionary print(&quot;Birthday:&quot;, person[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot;Email:&quot;, person[&quot;Email&quot;]) print(&quot;FavoriteFoods:&quot;, &quot;, &quot;.join(person[&quot;FavoriteFoods&quot;])) print(&quot;Hobbies:&quot;, &quot;, &quot;.join(person[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) print() print_data(InfoDb[0]) # Prints the data of the first person (Emaad Mir) .

For Loops . def for_loop(): # for every person in the InfoDB, print their data until there is nothing else to print for person in InfoDb: print_data(person) def for_loop_with_index(): # prints out data depending on the length of the dictionary it comes from for i in range(len(InfoDb)): print_data(InfoDb[i]) print(&quot;REGULAR FOR LOOP OUTPUT n&quot;) for_loop() print(&quot;FOR LOOP WITH INDEX OUTPUT n&quot;) for_loop_with_index() .

While Loops . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() . def while_loop(): # i starts at 0 i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): # while i is less than the length of the dictionary (2), keep printing the people&#39;s data print_data(InfoDb[i]) i = i + 1 def while_loop_reverse(): # this does the same thing as described above, except it prints in reverse order i = len(InfoDb) - 1 while i &gt;= 0: print_data(InfoDb[i]) i = i -1 print(&quot;REGULAR WHILE LOOP n&quot;) # labels the regular and reversed version of the list of people and their info while_loop() print(&quot;REVERSED WHILE LOOP n&quot;) while_loop_reverse() .

Recursive Loops . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; . the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing . ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends . def recursive(index): # the recursive loop will keep calling itself until it is greater than or equal to the length of the dictionary if index &gt;= len(InfoDb): return # this is where the code will end print_data(InfoDb[index]) # prints the data and keeps printing until it has reached the length of the dictionary return recursive(index + 1) print(&quot;RECURSIVE INDEX OUTPUT n&quot;) recursive(0) # the computer will begin printing person 0&#39;s data and keep calling itself until there are no more people left .

Adding Records to a Dictionary With User Input . You can also have a user input something so that they can add it to the dictionary. For example, the function below shows a user inputting a student&#39;s full name and their grade level, which, once printed, will display what the details of that student. . grade_level = {} for i in range(1): student_name = input(&quot;Enter the student&#39;s full name &quot;) student_grade = input(&quot;Enter the student&#39;s grade level&quot;) grade_level[student_name] = student_grade print(grade_level) . {&#39;Emaad Mir&#39;: &#39;10th&#39;} . Quiz that Stores Dictionaries . Last week, we were all assigned to create a Python quiz. This week, we also need to make a quiz, but it needs to store dictionaries. Below is a demonstration of how that works: . import getpass, sys def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question:&quot; +prompt) msg = input(&quot;Question:&quot; +prompt) print(&quot;Answer:&quot; +msg) ## defines the format of how the question will be asked def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) return msg qa_list = [] # Shows the list of questions and answers qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What syntax allows you to format and pass variables in html?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;liquid&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What is the instructions for what you want a computer to do called?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;input&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What is the name of the theme that your webpage has by default?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;minima&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;_______ involves calling itself repeatedly in order to achieve looping&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;recursion&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;Lists and ________ are used to collect information&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;dictionaries&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What is the name of the file that the style directory is stored in (just the name, don&#39;t need the type of file)?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;sass&quot; }) questions = len(qa_list) # number of questions equals the length of the list of questions and answers score = 0 # this is the score the user will begin with print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) # user will be prompted with this message before taking the quiz print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) response = question_with_response(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) if response == &quot;yes&quot;: # if user types in yes, the quiz will commence print(&quot;You said yes, so let&#39;s get started!&quot;) for q in qa_list: print(q[&quot;Question&quot;]) response = input(q[&quot;Question&quot;]) if response == q[&quot;Answer&quot;]: print(response + &quot; is correct! Great job!&quot;) # if the answer the user types in matches what is on the list, the user will get a point added to score score = score + 1 else: # if the user types something that doesn&#39;t match what&#39;s on the list, the user won&#39;t get a point print(response + &quot; is incorrect! Sorry!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot;, you scored &quot; + str(score) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions) + &quot;, which is &quot; + str((score / questions) * 100) + &quot;%&quot;) else: print(&quot;Maybe another time!&quot;) # if the user responds with no to the first prompt, the user will have this message and the code will end . Hello, root running /bin/python3 You will be asked 6 questions. Question: Are you ready to take a test? You said yes, so let&#39;s get started! What syntax allows you to format and pass variables in html? liquid is correct! Great job! What is the instructions for what you want a computer to do called? input is correct! Great job!

I might even try to design a game rather than a quiz on Code.org. We’ll have to see! . Final Product (9/11) . I made my quiz about space and was able to show the user’s final score and if they answered a question correctly or incorrectly. While I was successful in programming the quiz, there were a few obstacles that I faced along the way. For example, since I added a lot of text to each of my screens, if I ever was trying to edit a specific label, it would be difficult for me to scroll through all of my labels before finding the desired one. I also had a difficult time organizing my code so that it was more readable, as I completely forgot about dividing my code into sections until after I finished the program. Overall, while I did have a few issues in desigining this program, I still managed to successfully produce a quiz that can help a user learn something new about space. . Relating My Quiz to the Create Performance Task Rubric . While my quiz does follow some of the requirements of the CPT, it doesn’t necessarily meet all of them. However, if I can refine this quiz, I can definitely make it so that it meets all requirements for the CPT. Below are some connections to each of the components of the Create Performance Task Rubric: . Program Purpose and Function . Purpose: The purpose of the function is to test a user’s knowledge on specific facts about space and NASA. In addition, the quiz is also intended to teach the user something that they may not have known about before taking the quiz. | Functionality: When the user clicks the start button to begin the quiz, they will be shown one question at a time, with a total of four questions in the entire quiz. Each question is a different type: clicking on an image to choose an answer, clicking on a radio button, typing something into a text box, and clicking on a button. If the user gets a question correct, they will have a screen popping up informing them that they answered correctly and will have a point added to their score (predefined as a variable equal to 0). If the user gets a question wrong, they will have a screen that says they chose the wrong answer and will have no points taken away from or added to their score. At the end, the user will have their final score displayed. | Input/Output: For this quiz, the input is the answer the user clicks on/types in. The output is if they answered correctly or not, which is shown by the screen that displays after they have answered the question. | . Data Abstraction . All of the points that a user earned from the quiz is stored in a variable called score, and while I did not include any lists, I definitely could refine my quiz more by incorporating dictionaries and lists. . Managing Complexity . One way that my quiz could manage complexity is to store all of the possible answers for each question into their own functions, and add iterations that classify an answer as right or wrong. This way, I won’t have to repeat the same lines of code over and over again. . Procedural Abstraction . I can make my code so that depending on what the user has inputted, a specific part of the code will be ran. . Algorithm Implementation . My quiz uses sequencing, selecting, and iterating in order to form an algorithm involving the quiz that someone else could use and incorporate into their own quiz or game. . Testing . I tested this quiz multiple times, both in the process of creating the quiz and even after I fully programmed it. For the first call, I made it so that the user got a specific question wrong and got the other two correct, therefore displaying a final score of 2 out of 3. For the second call, I made it so that the user got two questions wrong and one correct, giving a final score of 1 out of 3. | . Improvements . Find a more efficient way of writing the code rather than having the same lines of code be repeated multiple times | Add more segments to the code so that different inputs will result in a completely different part of the code being run | Make a function that responds accordingly to a user’s input to a question. This way, there will not be any need to have to write the same lines of code for every incorrect or correct answer | .",

            "content": "Create Performance Task Idea . I want to make a program in which a user can input their daily agenda. This will include what work they want to do for the day, specific times of the day for those activities, and the duration of each item in the daily agenda. . My Idea and the CPT Rubric . Here is how I plan for my program to meet each component of the rubric: . Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program will be to encourage organization, as the user will input a list of activities they want to do for the day. Once the user has entered their specific things to do, the program will then compile what they have included into an organized, cohesive daily agenda. The program will also include specific details about how the user should go about doing a certain activity. . Row 2: Data Abstraction . What the user wants to do for the day will all be stored in a dictionary or list, which is what data abstraction essentially is. . Row 3: Managing Complexity . Using lists and dictionaries will manage the complexity because this way, there will not be any need to create a variable for every single activity that a user wants to do. . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . I will make a segment of a program in which the program can separate the activities into certain categories (sports, entertainment, etc.). This way, the output (daily agenda) that the user receives will be coherent and well-organized. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . I will be using sequencing, selecting, and iterating in order to make the program compile the daily agenda. . Row 6: Testing . This program will definitely be tested multiple times in order to both ensure it is properly functioning and also to enhance the understanding of my own program. . What I Know vs. What I Need to Know . While I have a good idea about what I could do for the program purpose and function, data abstraction, and testing part of the project, I do think that I need to learn a little bit more about managing complexity, procedural abstraction, and algorithm implementation. Knowing what each of these components are will be critical in making sure that my creation meets all of the College Board criteria. .",

List and Dictionary Purpose . Lists and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected, it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern . Dictionary is used to define data patterns. . Iteration is often used to process through lists. . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and hobbies. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and hobbies InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Emaad&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mir&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;January 12&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;emaadidrismir@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;FavoriteFoods&quot;: [&quot;French Fries, Ice Cream, Bananas, Pizza&quot;], &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Playing Squash&quot;, &quot;Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Hiking&quot;, &quot;Cooking&quot;, &quot;Playing Basketball&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Edwin&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Abraham&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 7&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;edwinab0007@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;FavoriteFoods&quot;: [&quot;Burgers, Pizza, Brownies, Watermelon&quot;], &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Biking&quot;,&quot;Hiking&quot;, &quot;Playing Video Games&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. . Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. . Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. . def print_data(person): # defines the data being printed print(&quot;Name:&quot;, person[&quot;FirstName&quot;], person[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # Tells the computer to print certain things from the dictionary print(&quot;Birthday:&quot;, person[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot;Email:&quot;, person[&quot;Email&quot;]) print(&quot;FavoriteFoods:&quot;, &quot;, &quot;.join(person[&quot;FavoriteFoods&quot;])) print(&quot;Hobbies:&quot;, &quot;, &quot;.join(person[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) print() print_data(InfoDb[0]) # Prints the data of the first person (Emaad Mir) .

For Loops . def for_loop(): # for every person in the InfoDB, print their data until there is nothing else to print for person in InfoDb: print_data(person) def for_loop_with_index(): # prints out data depending on the length of the dictionary it comes from for i in range(len(InfoDb)): print_data(InfoDb[i]) print(&quot;REGULAR FOR LOOP OUTPUT n&quot;) for_loop() print(&quot;FOR LOOP WITH INDEX OUTPUT n&quot;) for_loop_with_index() .

While Loops . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() . def while_loop(): # i starts at 0 i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): # while i is less than the length of the dictionary (2), keep printing the people&#39;s data print_data(InfoDb[i]) i = i + 1 def while_loop_reverse(): # this does the same thing as described above, except it prints in reverse order i = len(InfoDb) - 1 while i &gt;= 0: print_data(InfoDb[i]) i = i -1 print(&quot;REGULAR WHILE LOOP n&quot;) # labels the regular and reversed version of the list of people and their info while_loop() print(&quot;REVERSED WHILE LOOP n&quot;) while_loop_reverse() .

Recursive Loops . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; . the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing . ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends . def recursive(index): # the recursive loop will keep calling itself until it is greater than or equal to the length of the dictionary if index &gt;= len(InfoDb): return # this is where the code will end print_data(InfoDb[index]) # prints the data and keeps printing until it has reached the length of the dictionary return recursive(index + 1) print(&quot;RECURSIVE INDEX OUTPUT n&quot;) recursive(0) # the computer will begin printing person 0&#39;s data and keep calling itself until there are no more people left .

Adding Records to a Dictionary With User Input . You can also have a user input something so that they can add it to the dictionary. For example, the function below shows a user inputting a student&#39;s full name and their grade level, which, once printed, will display what the details of that student. . grade_level = {} for i in range(1): student_name = input(&quot;Enter the student&#39;s full name &quot;) student_grade = input(&quot;Enter the student&#39;s grade level&quot;) grade_level[student_name] = student_grade print(grade_level) . {&#39;Emaad Mir&#39;: &#39;10th&#39;} . Quiz that Stores Dictionaries . Last week, we were all assigned to create a Python quiz. This week, we also need to make a quiz, but it needs to store dictionaries. Below is a demonstration of how that works: . import getpass, sys def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question:&quot; +prompt) msg = input(&quot;Question:&quot; +prompt) print(&quot;Answer:&quot; +msg) ## defines the format of how the question will be asked def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) return msg qa_list = [] # Shows the list of questions and answers qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What syntax allows you to format and pass variables in html?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;liquid&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What is the instructions for what you want a computer to do called?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;input&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What is the name of the theme that your webpage has by default?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;minima&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;_______ involves calling itself repeatedly in order to achieve looping&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;recursion&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;Lists and ________ are used to collect information&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;dictionaries&quot;, }) qa_list.append({ &quot;Question&quot;: &quot;What is the name of the file that the style directory is stored in (just the name, don&#39;t need the type of file)?&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;sass&quot; }) questions = len(qa_list) # number of questions equals the length of the list of questions and answers score = 0 # this is the score the user will begin with print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) # user will be prompted with this message before taking the quiz print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) response = question_with_response(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) if response == &quot;yes&quot;: # if user types in yes, the quiz will commence print(&quot;You said yes, so let&#39;s get started!&quot;) for q in qa_list: print(q[&quot;Question&quot;]) response = input(q[&quot;Question&quot;]) if response == q[&quot;Answer&quot;]: print(response + &quot; is correct! Great job!&quot;) # if the answer the user types in matches what is on the list, the user will get a point added to score score = score + 1 else: # if the user types something that doesn&#39;t match what&#39;s on the list, the user won&#39;t get a point print(response + &quot; is incorrect! Sorry!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot;, you scored &quot; + str(score) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions) + &quot;, which is &quot; + str((score / questions) * 100) + &quot;%&quot;) else: print(&quot;Maybe another time!&quot;) # if the user responds with no to the first prompt, the user will have this message and the code will end . Hello, root running /bin/python3 You will be asked 6 questions. Question: Are you ready to take a test? You said yes, so let&#39;s get started! What syntax allows you to format and pass variables in html? liquid is correct! Great job! What is the instructions for what you want a computer to do called? input is correct! Great job! What is the name of the theme that your webpage has by default? minima is correct! Great job! _______ involves calling itself repeatedly in order to achieve looping recursion is correct! Great job! Lists and ________ are used to collect information dictionaries is correct! Great job! What is the name of the file that the style directory is stored in (just the name, don&#39;t need the type of file)? sass is correct! Great job! root, you scored 6/6, which is 100.0% .",

            "content": "Paper Chromatography Lab . By: Emaad Mir, Bryan Wang, Steven Zhu, Anay Sabhnani . Period 1 . Materials: Expo Marker, Felt Pen, Sharpie, Crayola, paper slip, mystery sample, 70% Isopropyl alcohol, beaker . Procedure: . Place four dots, one for each marker, in a row near the bottom of the paper slip. . | Fill a beaker with 10 mL of isopropyl . | Dip the bottom of the paper slip into the beaker of isopropyl alcohol and let it sit for 10 minutes . | Measure Rf values for each color per ink dot . | . The Science Behind Paper Chromatography: . Paper is made up of cellulose, which contains the chemical compound OH, which is polar. Due to the nature of the structure and the polarity of OH, cellulose is polar . | The mobile phase, or the solvent of 70% isopropyl alcohol (nonpolar), moves up the paper through capillary action. In doing so, it also carries soluble compounds along with it. . | After the mobile phase has moved up as far as it can go, the different ink dots will have moved up as well, each a different distance. . | This is because of the polarity of the ink dots. Since the mobile phase is nonpolar and the stationary phase is polar, the ink dots have moved up different lengths because of their differing polarities. . | A dot that has moved up very close to the solvent front, with the nonpolar mobile phase, would be very nonpolar, as it had little to no attraction to the polar stationary phase and was soluble in the mobile phase because like dissolves like, and was carried up with the mobile phase very easily. . | A dot that has not moved up very much at all would be more polar, as it had a stronger attraction to the polar stationary phase than the nonpolar mobile phase. . | Because of separation by polarity, we can use paper chromatography and the unique polarity of each ink type to find the ransom note’s ink. . | . CER: Who Was The Thief? . C: The marker used by the thief was the expo marker. . E: . Marker Rf Values (respective to colors) Colors . Expo | 0.648, 0.755, and 0.971 | Yellow, Pink, and Blue | . Sharpie | 0.516 and 0.628 | Gray and Purple | . Crayola | 0.720 and 0.988 | Pink and Blue | . Felt | 0.510, 0.779, and 0.991 | Green, Pink, and Blue | . Mystery Sample | 0.553, 0.723, and 0.940 | Yellow, Pink, and Blue | . R: Through qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing each marker’s colors and values, the marker that the thief used can be determined. In terms of qualitative data, it can be observed that the mystery marker is made up of three different compounds that are yellow, blue, and pink. The expo marker is also made up of yellow, pink, and blue compounds, making it the best match for what the thief used because the colors match. The sharpie is made of gray and purple compounds, meaning that it is not a match. The Crayola marker is only made with pink and blue compounds, so it is also unlikely that the thief used the Crayola marker. The felt tip is made up of blue, green, and pink compounds, so it is not a match. In terms of quantitative data, the retention factors of the compounds from the mystery sample were 0.553, 0.723, and 0.940, while the retention factors for the Expo marker were 0.648, 0.755, and 0.971, making the Expo marker’s values closest to that of the mystery’s. The sharpie and Crayola can be ruled out because they lack third Rf values. The felt spot’s Rf values are also somewhat close to the Mystery sample’s, but as proven in the qualitative analysis, it cannot be the pen used by the thief. Because the Expo marker had the greatest quantitative and qualitative similarities with the mystery marker, it can be concluded that the thief used the Expo marker in writing the ransom note. .",
