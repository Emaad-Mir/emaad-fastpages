    "- What are simulations?\n",
    "    - Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world\n",
    "    - They can use a mathematical description or model of a real thing in the form of a computer program\n",
    "- What are the purposes/uses of simulations?\n",
    "    - Purposes include drawing inferences without the constraints of the real world\n",
    "        - Essentially, they allow us to study systems or other things that cannot be easily or safely done so in real life\n",
    "- Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon\n",
    "- When developing a simulation, it is often necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects, for simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded\n",
    "- Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses or theories under consideration\n",
    "- The variability, randomness, and overall complex nature of the role is considered in using random number generators\n",
    "- Examples of well-known simulations include rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, and analysis of chemicals/reactions"
