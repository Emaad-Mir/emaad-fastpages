    "    User.query.all() is a method provided by SQLAlchemy to query (retrieve data from the database) all records in the User table. It returns a list of User objects that represent all the records in the table.\n",

    "    The json_ready variable is assigned a list of JSON objects that represent the records in the User table. The list is generated using a list comprehension, which is an efficient way of generating lists in Python. The list comprehension [user.read() for user in table] loops through each User object in the table list and calls the read() method on each object, which returns a JSON representation of the user. The resulting list of JSON objects is then assigned to the json_ready variable."
