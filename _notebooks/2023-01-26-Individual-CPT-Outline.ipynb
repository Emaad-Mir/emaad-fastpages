    "## Overview of Our Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of our project is called \"Theee Arcade\", and the project is intended to serve as an arcade for users to provide them with an immersive, fun experience. The users will have multiple games to choose from and will even be able to view a leader board to see where they are compared to other registered users. On Thursday, we were to present our project idea to the class, but due to the time constraint of 3-5 minutes, we were not quite able to say everything that we wanted to present. This blog serves to talk about our project but in more detail, with heavy emphasis on my individual part of the project."

    "In this VERY rough model, you can see that at the very top, there is a link to every single game that the user can play (mine in bold to indicate that this is for the hangman page). This is essentially how we want to present the other games to the users if they decide they want to play something else. For my page specifically, I plan to have the blanks displayed as well as a letter bank so that the user knows which letters they have already guessed. The hangman will also be shown, with more body parts (head, arms, legs, etc.) appearing as the number of incorrect guesses increases. While this is not specifically in the rough model above, I also am thinking of implementing a time elapsed clock (no time limit, though), as the time taken to guess a certain word would fit well with the leader board that we want to include."

    "### What I am Happy With\n",
    "- My code sample does actually meet some of the College Board Criteria, and this will definitely be helpful as the deadline for our CPT begins approaching\n",
    "- I can describe in enough detail how my code works, which will be important when I write my written response\n",
    "- My wire frame for the project actually gives me a great idea of how I want everything to be presented to the user and will be a good reference to keep with me as I make more progress on it\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I am Concerned About\n",
    "- Although what I have thus far is a good start, I am worried that the end product will not have enough depth or complexity to it (not necessarily inefficiency), which can be problematic if I want to get full points on the CPT\n",
    "- My sample code mainly lacks algorithm implementation, and I am concerned that I will not be able to properly incorporate that into the final submission and that I will not be able to describe it in enough detail so that someone else could recreate it\n",
    "- With games such as Hangman, there is no complex mathematical algorithm that goes into fulfilling the overall functionality of the program, as most of it just involves words or letters. I am therefore worried that by not having some mathematical component involved in the algorithm, my algorithm will not include the necessary sequencing, selection, and iteration, thus preventing me from getting the point for that row."

    "Overall, even though there are several setbacks and limitations to the plan that I have, what I have so far is a great start and is definitely something that I can work with so that it can be improved or more refined. I will make sure to clear up the concerns that I have by maybe researching algorithms that go into making these kinds of games and using it as a source of inspiration (and citing it, of course). By doing this, I will feel much more confident about incorporating the algorithm into my program and modifying it so that it has more depth to it. While my part of the project is very important, my teammates also have their own projects to work on, and I will make sure that I help them if needed, as we will all need to present our parts for N@tM. In essence, I think I have a great idea for how I want my program to turn out in the end and can explain how it meets the College Board criteria to someone who may not be familiar with how the project was made, the rubric, or even both.
