    "- Searching when it comes to computer programs and applications involves locating and retrieving a data value/and or its index\n",

    "    - Cannot keep up with increasing input sizes, as the longer the array, the more time that it will take for the search to check\n",
    "    - In other words, as the input lists gets larger, the runtime of the program increases \"linearly\" as well\n",
    "- Binary Search - a more efficient way to check through a sorted list to find a specific value\n",
    "    - Involves checking the medium or middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is higher or lower than the middle value\n",
    "    - If the list is not sorted or in a proper order, the binary search algorithm cannot work anymore\n",
    "    - The maximum number of cycles in a binary search is equivalent to the log base 2 of the closest, next power of 2, to the length of the list\n",
