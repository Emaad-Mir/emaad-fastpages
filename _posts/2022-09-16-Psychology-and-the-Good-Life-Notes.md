# Notes/Vocab from the Video

- We (as students) can improve whatever level of well-being that we are at; we can control a lot more of our happiness than we think
- Our life circumstances don't matter as much as we think they do
- **intuitions** - ability to understand something right away without the need for conscious reasoning
- Like all good things, taking control of your happiness can be difficult
- **G.I. Joe fallacy** - refers to the misconception that simply knowing about a bias is enough to overcome it
- Often, your mind lies to you a lot about what it means to be happy
- Making time for social connections is something that very happy people do in general
- Helping others helps us more than we expect
- The simple act of thinking about what we are grateful for is very powerful
