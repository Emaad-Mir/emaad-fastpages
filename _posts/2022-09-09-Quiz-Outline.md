description: Here are some ideas I have for my quiz on code.org. Not all of these ideas will be incorporated into the quiz,
but some of them will be helpful in establishing the final product. I hope this inspires others to be creative with their project!

# Ideas for the Topic of My Quiz

-Something I could use as a study tool for another class (calc, chem, etc.)
-Quiz about random famous people
-Quiz about CSP vocab (sequence, data abstraction, liquid syntax, etc.)

# How I Want the Code to Function

-User will be prompted with a specific message depending on if they correctly or incorrectly answered a question
-User will not get another chance to answer a question right after getting it wrong
-The user will have their final score out of the number of questions after they have finished the quiz

I might even try to design a game rather than a quiz on Code.org. We'll have to see!

More ideas to come!
