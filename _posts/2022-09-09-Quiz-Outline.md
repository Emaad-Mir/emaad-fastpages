# Ideas for the Topic of My Quiz (9/9)

- Something I could use as a study tool for another class (calc, chem, etc.)
- Quiz about random famous people
- Quiz about CSP vocab (sequence, data abstraction, liquid syntax, etc.)

# How I Want the Code to Function (9/9)

- User will be prompted with a specific message depending on if they correctly or incorrectly answered a question
- User will not get another chance to answer a question right after getting it wrong
- The user will have their final score out of the number of questions after they have finished the quiz

I might even try to design a game rather than a quiz on Code.org. We'll have to see!

# Final Product (9/11)
I made my quiz about space and was able to show the user's final score and if they answered a question correctly or incorrectly. While I was successful in programming the quiz, there were a few obstacles that I faced along the way. For example, since I added a lot of text to each of my screens, if I ever was trying to edit a specific label, it would be difficult for me to scroll through all of my labels before finding the desired one. I also had a difficult time organizing my code so that it was more readable, as I completely forgot about dividing my code into sections until after I finished the program. Overall, while I did have a few issues in desigining this program, I still managed to successfully produce a quiz that can help a user learn something new about space.
