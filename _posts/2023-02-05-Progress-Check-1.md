# Overview

This blog serves as a status on our CPT project so far, and includes important things such as what I have done so far, what I plan to do for next week onwards, and much more. I hope that the content here helps anyone who may be struggling to think of a plan for their project.

# Recap: What is Our Project?

The name of our project is called "Theee Arcade", and it is intended to serve as an arcade for users to provide them with an immersive, fun experience. The users will have multiple games to choose from and will even be able to view a leader board to see where they are compared to other registered users.

In addition to what our project actually is, below is a table that connects what we are doing to College Board's six criteria for the Create Performance Task: 

|Row on the rubric|Application to my project|
|-----------|-----------|
|Program Purpose and Function|The purpose of my project is to entertain and challenge the user by having them guess a word with no hints provided. |
|Data Abstraction|My project uses several lists (blanks and progress) to store the number of letters that the user has guessed correctly to be in the word (two code segments to be determined)|
|Managing Complexity|The project uses lists to store the user's entries, which is far more efficient and less time consuming than making a variable for every single entry that the user inputs correctly.|
|Procedural Abstraction|The procedure update_progress uses sequencing, selecting, and iteration to keep track of the user's progress in guessing the word. Once the progress made is equal to the word randomly generated, the user has officially won.|
|Algorithm Implementation|My project will call the procedure as described above, although I will continue to figure out more ways to make the algorithm have more depth and complexity to it (not inefficient).|
|Testing|A new word will be randomly generated each round with differing results for each of the two test runs (still figuring this row out as well)|

# What Progress Have I Made Thus Far?

For the first week, we were given a few coding hours in class to begin working on our project for both N@tM and the CPT. The rest of this blog goes into detail on some of the tangibles that I have thus far for this week, as well as any problems/concerns that I have regarding it.


# Tangible 1: Flask/JavaScript Table

Below is an image of two of the same table, with one made in Flask and one made in JavaScript. The table that is made with Flask or JavaScript is clearly labeled at the top of each table:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tangible1.png "https://github.com/Emaad-Mir/emaad-fastpages")

The table made above serves almost as a menu of games for the user to choose from once they go to our main arcade page. It will kind of resemble an entrance to a real life arcade. When the user gets to this page, they will be able to see the name of each game, the description of each game, and when the game was made. While this is not visible in the image above, I will also be adding a column that includes the link to each game in the table. Once the user clicks on the link to whatever game they choose, they will then be presented with the main page corresponding to that game created by one of us (ex. they could be brought to the Hangman page created by me!).

## What I am Concerned About

While I have a pretty solid idea on how I want to implement this table into our project, I am concerned about how I will make the table look nice when it is presented to the user. Even though design should be the least of my worries at this point, I still would like to make those who test this application excited when they first look at the page with this table. This way, they will be more drawn into the games and will look forward to seeing how everything works out.
