# 1.1: Daily Video 1

- A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function
- A computing innovation can be physical, nonphysical computer software, or nonphysical computing concept
- Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations
- Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it

# Daily Video 1: Takeaways

- Interpersonal skills learned through collaboration:
    - Communication
    - Consensus Building
    - Conflict Resolution
    - Negotiation

# 1.1: Daily Video 2

- Pair Programming
    - Two programmers work together as a pair
    - One programmer is the driver, who writes code, and the other programmer is the observer/pointer/navigator, who reviews each line of code as it is typed in

- Think-Pair-Share
    - Students first think through a problem by themselves, pair up with a partner to exchange ideas, and then share findings with the class

- Leave Comments in Code!
    - Communicate to your partner(s)
    - Communicate to yourself
    - Acknowledge code segments used from other sources
    - Acknowledge media used from other sources
    - Differentiate what you and your partner(s) did
    - Clarify the functionality of your code

- How to Collaborate in Class
    - Online Tools
        - repl.it - multiplayer
        - GitHub - collaboration and repository
        - Shared document or folder
    - Ask friends and family to test drive your prgoram and give you feedback!
    - Check with your teacher for your coding platform

# Daily Video 2: Takeaways

- Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations
- Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives
- Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents
- Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration

# Personal Takeways

Watching these videos definitely opened my mind to how crucial collaboration is, especially in a field like computer science. I hope that from now on, my team and I will be able to communicate with each other and help each other no matter the circumstances.
