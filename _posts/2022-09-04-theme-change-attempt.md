By default, your web page has the theme minima as shown in the image below in config.yml:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/config-file.png "https://github.com/Emaad-Mir/emaad-fastpages")

The minima theme is okay, but I wanted to try something different to spice up my web page a little bit. I did this by looking for supported themes I could switch to and changing the jekyll theme from minima to midnight:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/proof.png "https://github.com/Emaad-Mir/emaad-fastpages")

However, when I went onto my web page to see the results, I got this:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/results.png "https://github.com/Emaad-Mir/emaad-fastpages")

As you can see, all of the links that I had on the top right of the web page (about me, tags, vocab etc.) completely disappeared. The only button that you can see is the "View on GitHub" button. Changing the remote theme also altered the way my posts were displayed on my blog.
