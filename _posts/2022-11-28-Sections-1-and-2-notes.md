# Unit 3.1 Variables and Assignments

Key points:
- Variables are abstractions within programs which represent a value
- Values can be individual data points or a list/collection that contains many data values
- Types of data: numbers, Booleans (T/F), lists, and strings

## Variables and Assignments in Python
- To define a variable, simply type in the variable name and use the equal sign to set it equal to its value
- Variable can be defined using numbers, string, list, or boolean (strings must have quotations around it and lists must be surrounded by square brackets)
- Dictionaries
- Interchanging variables
- Floats
- Even Function

## Variables and Assignments in JavaScript
- One way to assign a variable is doing var (variable name) = value;
- Another way to assign a variable is using const (variable name) = value;

# Unit 3.2 Data Abstraction

Key points:
- Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation
- Data abstraction manages complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific elements of the representation
- Data Abstraction makes it easier to implement, develop, and maintain code
- The use of lists allows for multiple related values to be treated as a single value

## Data Abstraction in Python
- Simple lists/working with variables
- A list of data can be further segregated using more similar characteristics in the data
- Breaking lists into more lists can be used to organize data received from APIs and other resources
- Individual elements can be called, separated, and organized using for loops
- The split() method splits a string into a list
- Default separator is any whitespace
- The join() method takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string. A string must be specified as a separator
