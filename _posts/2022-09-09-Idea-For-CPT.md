# Create Performance Task Idea

I want to make a program in which a user can input their daily agenda. This will include what work they want to do for the day, specific times of the day for those activities, and the duration of each item in the daily agenda. 

# My Idea and the CPT Rubric

Here is how I plan for my program to meet each component of the rubric:

# Row 1: Program Purpose and Function
The purpose of this program will be to encourage organization, as the user will input a list of activities they want to do for the day. Once the user has entered their specific things to do, the program will then compile what they have included into an organized, cohesive daily agenda. The program will also include specific details about how the user should go about doing a certain activity. 

# Row 2: Data Abstraction
What the user wants to do for the day will all be stored in a dictionary or list, which is what data abstraction essentially is.


# Row 3: Managing Complexity
Using lists and dictionaries will manage the complexity because this way, there will not be any need to create a variable for every single activity that a user wants to do. 


# Row 4: Procedural Abstraction
I will make a segment of a program in which the program can separate the activities into certain categories (sports, entertainment, etc.). This way, the output (daily agenda) that the user receives will be coherent and well-organized.


# Row 5: Algorithm Implementation
I will be using sequencing, selecting, and iterating in order to make the program compile the daily agenda.


# Row 6: Testing
This program will definitely be tested multiple times in order to both ensure it is properly functioning and also to enhance the understanding of my own program.

# What I Know vs. What I Need to Know

While I have a good idea about what I could do for the program purpose and function, data abstraction, and testing part of the project, I do think that I need to learn a little bit more about managing complexity, procedural abstraction, and algorithm implementation. Knowing what each of these components are will be critical in making sure that my creation meets all of the College Board criteria.
